# Configuring Noctalia

Noctalia provides a built-in settings interface that makes configuration easy and accessible. You can configure almost every aspect of the shell through the graphical user interface.

### Accessing the Settings

[Section titled “Accessing the Settings”](https://docs.noctalia.dev/configuration/configure-noctalia/#accessing-the-settings)

You can open the Noctalia settings in several ways:

1. **From the Control Center**: Click the settings icon in the control center panel
2. **From the Bar**: Right-Click on the bar to access the Control Center then click on the settings button
3. **Using keybinds**: Search for “Settings” in the [Keybinds Reference](https://docs.noctalia.dev/getting-started/keybinds)

All settings are organized into intuitive categories, allowing you to customize:

* General appearance and behavior
* Theming and colors
* Bar configuration and widgets
* Panel settings
* Notifications
* And much more

Changes take effect immediately, and all settings are automatically saved.
