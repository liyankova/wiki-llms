# hyprpaper

[hyprpaper](https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprpaper) is a fast, IPC-controlled wallpaper utility for Hyprland.

## Installation

**Arch**

```
pacman -S hyprpaper
```

**openSUSE**

```
zypper install hyprpaper
```

**Fedora**

```
sudo dnf install hyprpaper
```

## Configuration

The config file is located at `~/.config/hypr/hyprpaper.conf`. It is not
required.

### Setting wallpapers

Wallpapers are set as anonymous special categories. Monitor can be left empty for a fallback.

| variable | description | value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `monitor` | Monitor to display this wallpaper on. If empty, will use this wallpaper as a fallback | monitor ID |
| `path` | Path to an image file or a directory containing image files (non recursively) | path |
| `fit_mode` | Determines how to display the image. Optional and defaults to `cover` | `contain`|`cover`|`tile`|`fill` |
| `timeout` | Timeout between each wallpaper change (in seconds, if `path` is a directory). Optional and defaults to 30 seconds | int |

```
wallpaper {
    monitor = DP-3
    path = ~/myFile.jxl
    fit_mode = cover
}

wallpaper {
    monitor = DP-2
    path = ~/myFile2.jxl
    fit_mode = cover
}

wallpaper {
    monitor = 
    path = ~/fallback.jxl
    fit_mode = cover
}

# ...
```

### Run at Startup

To run hyprpaper at startup edit `hyprland.conf` and add: `exec-once = hyprpaper`.  
If you start Hyprland with [uwsm](https://wiki.hypr.land/Useful-Utilities/Systemd-start), you can also use the `systemctl --user enable --now hyprpaper.service` command.

### Misc Options

These should be set outside of the `wallpaper{...}` sections.

| variable | description | type | default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `splash` | enable rendering of the hyprland splash over the wallpaper | bool | `true` |
| `splash_offset` | how far up should the splash be displayed | float | `20` |
| `splash_opacity` | how opaque the splash is | float | `0.8` |
| `ipc` | whether to enable IPC | bool | `true` |

### Sourcing

Use the `source` keyword to source another file. Globbing, tilde expansion and relative paths are supported.

```
source = ~/.config/hypr/hyprpaper.d/*.conf
```

Please note it’s LINEAR. Meaning lines above the `source =` will be parsed first, then lines inside `~/.config/hypr/hyprpaper.d/*.conf` files, then lines below.

## IPC

hyprpaper supports IPC via `hyprctl`. You can set wallpapers like so:

```
hyprctl hyprpaper wallpaper '[mon], [path], [fit_mode]'
```

`fit_mode` is optional, and `mon` can be empty for a fallback, just like in the config file. The fallback wallpaper only applies to monitors that have never had a specific monitor target assigned.
