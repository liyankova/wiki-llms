# Meet the Team

React development is led by a dedicated team working full time at Meta. It also receives contributions from people all over the world.

## React Core

The React Core team members work full time on the core component APIs, the engine that powers React DOM and React Native, React DevTools, and the React documentation website.

Current members of the React team are listed in alphabetical order below.

### Mike Vitousek

Engineer at Meta

Mike went to grad school dreaming of becoming a professor but realized that he liked building things a lot more than writing grant applications. Mike joined Meta to work on Javascript infrastructure, which ultimately led him to work on the React Compiler.

### Sebastian Markbåge

Engineer at Vercel

Sebastian majored in psychology. He’s usually quiet. Even when he says something, it often doesn’t make sense to the rest of us until a few months later. The correct way to pronounce his surname is “mark-boa-geh” but he settled for “mark-beige” out of pragmatism — and that’s how he approaches React.

### Sebastian Silbermann

Engineer at Vercel

Sebastian learned programming to make the browser games he played during class more enjoyable. Eventually this lead to contributing to as much open source code as possible. Outside of coding he’s busy making sure people don’t confuse him with the other Sebastians and Zilberman of the React community.

### Seth Webster

Engineering Manager at Meta

Seth started programming as a kid growing up in Tucson, AZ. After school, he was bitten by the music bug and was a touring musician for about 10 years before returning to *work*, starting with Intuit. In his spare time, he loves [taking pictures](https://www.sethwebster.com) and flying for animal rescues in the northeastern United States.

### Sophie Alpert

Independent Engineer

Four days after React was released, Sophie rewrote the entirety of her then-current project to use it, which she now realizes was perhaps a bit reckless. After she became the project’s #1 committer, she wondered why she wasn’t getting paid by Facebook like everyone else was and joined the team officially to lead React through its adolescent years. Though she quit that job years ago, somehow she’s still in the team’s group chats and “providing value”.

### Yuzhi Zheng

Engineering Manager at Meta

Yuzhi studied Computer Science in school. She liked the instant gratification of seeing code come to life without having to physically be in a laboratory. Now she’s a manager in the React org. Before management, she used to work on the Relay data fetching framework. In her spare time, Yuzhi enjoys optimizing her life via gardening and home improvement projects.
