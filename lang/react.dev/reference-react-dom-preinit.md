# preinit

### Note

[React-based frameworks](https://react.dev/learn/creating-a-react-app) frequently handle resource loading for you, so you might not have to call this API yourself. Consult your framework’s documentation for details.

`preinit` lets you eagerly fetch and evaluate a stylesheet or external script.

```
preinit("https://example.com/script.js", {as: "script"});
```

## Reference

### `preinit(href, options)`

To preinit a script or stylesheet, call the `preinit` function from `react-dom`.

```
import { preinit } from 'react-dom';

function AppRoot() {

preinit("https://example.com/script.js", {as: "script"});

// ...

}
```

[See more examples below.](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/preinit#usage)

The `preinit` function provides the browser with a hint that it should start downloading and executing the given resource, which can save time. Scripts that you `preinit` are executed when they finish downloading. Stylesheets that you preinit are inserted into the document, which causes them to go into effect right away.

#### Parameters

* `href`: a string. The URL of the resource you want to download and execute.
* `options`: an object. It contains the following properties:
  + `as`: a required string. The type of resource. Its possible values are `script` and `style`.
  + `precedence`: a string. Required with stylesheets. Says where to insert the stylesheet relative to others. Stylesheets with higher precedence can override those with lower precedence. The possible values are `reset`, `low`, `medium`, `high`.
  + `crossOrigin`: a string. The [CORS policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin) to use. Its possible values are `anonymous` and `use-credentials`.
  + `integrity`: a string. A cryptographic hash of the resource, to [verify its authenticity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity).
  + `nonce`: a string. A cryptographic [nonce to allow the resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/nonce) when using a strict Content Security Policy.
  + `fetchPriority`: a string. Suggests a relative priority for fetching the resource. The possible values are `auto` (the default), `high`, and `low`.

#### Returns

`preinit` returns nothing.

#### Caveats

* Multiple calls to `preinit` with the same `href` have the same effect as a single call.
* In the browser, you can call `preinit` in any situation: while rendering a component, in an Effect, in an event handler, and so on.
* In server-side rendering or when rendering Server Components, `preinit` only has an effect if you call it while rendering a component or in an async context originating from rendering a component. Any other calls will be ignored.

## Usage

### Preiniting when rendering

Call `preinit` when rendering a component if you know that it or its children will use a specific resource, and you’re OK with the resource being evaluated and thereby taking effect immediately upon being downloaded.

#### Examples of preiniting

#### Example 1 of 2: Preiniting an external script

```
import { preinit } from 'react-dom';

function AppRoot() {

preinit("https://example.com/script.js", {as: "script"});

return ...;

}
```

If you want the browser to download the script but not to execute it right away, use [`preload`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/preload) instead. If you want to load an ESM module, use [`preinitModule`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/preinitModule).

### Preiniting in an event handler

Call `preinit` in an event handler before transitioning to a page or state where external resources will be needed. This gets the process started earlier than if you call it during the rendering of the new page or state.

```
import { preinit } from 'react-dom';

function CallToAction() {

const onClick = () => {

preinit("https://example.com/wizardStyles.css", {as: "style"});

startWizard();

}

return (

<button onClick={onClick}>Start Wizard</button>

);

}
```
