# Built-in React DOM Hooks – React

[API Reference](https://react.dev/reference/react)

# Built-in React DOM Hooks

The `react-dom` package contains Hooks that are only supported for web applications (which run in the browser DOM environment). These Hooks are not supported in non-browser environments like iOS, Android, or Windows applications. If you are looking for Hooks that are supported in web browsers *and other environments* see [the React Hooks page](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks). This page lists all the Hooks in the `react-dom` package.

## Form Hooks

*Forms* let you create interactive controls for submitting information. To manage forms in your components, use one of these Hooks:

* [`useFormStatus`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/hooks/useFormStatus) allows you to make updates to the UI based on the status of a form.

```
function Form({ action }) {

async function increment(n) {

return n + 1;

}

const [count, incrementFormAction] = useActionState(increment, 0);

return (

<form action={action}>

<button formAction={incrementFormAction}>Count: {count}</button>

<Button />

</form>

);

}

function Button() {

const { pending } = useFormStatus();

return (

<button disabled={pending} type="submit">

Submit

</button>

);

}
```
