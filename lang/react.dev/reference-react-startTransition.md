## Reference

### `startTransition(action)`

The `startTransition` function lets you mark a state update as a Transition.

```
import { startTransition } from 'react';

function TabContainer() {

const [tab, setTab] = useState('about');

function selectTab(nextTab) {

startTransition(() => {

setTab(nextTab);

});

}

// ...

}
```

[See more examples below.](https://react.dev/reference/react/startTransition#usage)

#### Parameters

* `action`: A function that updates some state by calling one or more [`set` functions](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#setstate). React calls `action` immediately with no parameters and marks all state updates scheduled synchronously during the `action` function call as Transitions. Any async calls awaited in the `action` will be included in the transition, but currently require wrapping any `set` functions after the `await` in an additional `startTransition` (see [Troubleshooting](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#react-doesnt-treat-my-state-update-after-await-as-a-transition)). State updates marked as Transitions will be [non-blocking](https://react.dev/reference/react/startTransition#marking-a-state-update-as-a-non-blocking-transition) and [will not display unwanted loading indicators.](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#preventing-unwanted-loading-indicators).

#### Returns

`startTransition` does not return anything.

#### Caveats

* `startTransition` does not provide a way to track whether a Transition is pending. To show a pending indicator while the Transition is ongoing, you need [`useTransition`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition) instead.
* You can wrap an update into a Transition only if you have access to the `set` function of that state. If you want to start a Transition in response to some prop or a custom Hook return value, try [`useDeferredValue`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useDeferredValue) instead.
* The function you pass to `startTransition` is called immediately, marking all state updates that happen while it executes as Transitions. If you try to perform state updates in a `setTimeout`, for example, they won’t be marked as Transitions.
* You must wrap any state updates after any async requests in another `startTransition` to mark them as Transitions. This is a known limitation that we will fix in the future (see [Troubleshooting](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition#react-doesnt-treat-my-state-update-after-await-as-a-transition)).
* A state update marked as a Transition will be interrupted by other state updates. For example, if you update a chart component inside a Transition, but then start typing into an input while the chart is in the middle of a re-render, React will restart the rendering work on the chart component after handling the input state update.
* Transition updates can’t be used to control text inputs.
* If there are multiple ongoing Transitions, React currently batches them together. This is a limitation that may be removed in a future release.

## Usage

### Marking a state update as a non-blocking Transition

You can mark a state update as a *Transition* by wrapping it in a `startTransition` call:

```
import { startTransition } from 'react';

function TabContainer() {

const [tab, setTab] = useState('about');

function selectTab(nextTab) {

startTransition(() => {

setTab(nextTab);

});

}

// ...

}
```

Transitions let you keep the user interface updates responsive even on slow devices.

With a Transition, your UI stays responsive in the middle of a re-render. For example, if the user clicks a tab but then change their mind and click another tab, they can do that without waiting for the first re-render to finish.

### Note

`startTransition` is very similar to [`useTransition`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition), except that it does not provide the `isPending` flag to track whether a Transition is ongoing. You can call `startTransition` when `useTransition` is not available. For example, `startTransition` works outside components, such as from a data library.
