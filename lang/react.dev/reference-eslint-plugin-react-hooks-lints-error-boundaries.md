# error-boundaries – React

[API Reference](https://react.dev/reference/react)

[Lints](https://react.dev/reference/eslint-plugin-react-hooks)

# error-boundaries

Validates usage of Error Boundaries instead of try/catch for errors in child components.

## Rule Details

Try/catch blocks can’t catch errors that happen during React’s rendering process. Errors thrown in rendering methods or hooks bubble up through the component tree. Only [Error Boundaries](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary) can catch these errors.

### Invalid

Examples of incorrect code for this rule:

```
// ❌ Try/catch won't catch render errors

function Parent() {

try {

return <ChildComponent />; // If this throws, catch won't help

} catch (error) {

return <div>Error occurred</div>;

}

}
```

### Valid

Examples of correct code for this rule:

```
// ✅ Using error boundary

function Parent() {

return (

<ErrorBoundary>

<ChildComponent />

</ErrorBoundary>

);

}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Why is the linter telling me not to wrap `use` in `try`/`catch`?

The `use` hook doesn’t throw errors in the traditional sense, it suspends component execution. When `use` encounters a pending promise, it suspends the component and lets React show a fallback. Only Suspense and Error Boundaries can handle these cases. The linter warns against `try`/`catch` around `use` to prevent confusion as the `catch` block would never run.

```
// ❌ Try/catch around `use` hook

function Component({promise}) {

try {

const data = use(promise); // Won't catch - `use` suspends, not throws

return <div>{data}</div>;

} catch (error) {

return <div>Failed to load</div>; // Unreachable

}

}

// ✅ Error boundary catches `use` errors

function App() {

return (

<ErrorBoundary fallback={<div>Failed to load</div>}>

<Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>

<DataComponent promise={fetchData()} />

</Suspense>

</ErrorBoundary>

);

}
```
