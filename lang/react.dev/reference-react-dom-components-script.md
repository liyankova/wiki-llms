# <script>

The [built-in browser `<script>` component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script) lets you add a script to your document.

```
<script> alert("hi!") </script>
```

## Reference

### `<script>`

To add inline or external scripts to your document, render the [built-in browser `<script>` component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script). You can render `<script>` from any component and React will [in certain cases](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/script#special-rendering-behavior) place the corresponding DOM element in the document head and de-duplicate identical scripts.

```
<script> alert("hi!") </script>

<script src="script.js" />
```

[See more examples below.](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/script#usage)

#### Props

`<script>` supports all [common element props.](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/common#common-props)

It should have *either* `children` or a `src` prop.

* `children`: a string. The source code of an inline script.
* `src`: a string. The URL of an external script.

Other supported props:

* `async`: a boolean. Allows the browser to defer execution of the script until the rest of the document has been processed — the preferred behavior for performance.
* `crossOrigin`: a string. The [CORS policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin) to use. Its possible values are `anonymous` and `use-credentials`.
* `fetchPriority`: a string. Lets the browser rank scripts in priority when fetching multiple scripts at the same time. Can be `"high"`, `"low"`, or `"auto"` (the default).
* `integrity`: a string. A cryptographic hash of the script, to [verify its authenticity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity).
* `noModule`: a boolean. Disables the script in browsers that support ES modules — allowing for a fallback script for browsers that do not.
* `nonce`: a string. A cryptographic [nonce to allow the resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/nonce) when using a strict Content Security Policy.
* `referrer`: a string. Says [what Referer header to send](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#referrerpolicy) when fetching the script and any resources that the script fetches in turn.
* `type`: a string. Says whether the script is a [classic script, ES module, or import map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type).

Props that disable React’s [special treatment of scripts](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/script#special-rendering-behavior):

* `onError`: a function. Called when the script fails to load.
* `onLoad`: a function. Called when the script finishes being loaded.

Props that are **not recommended** for use with React:

* `blocking`: a string. If set to `"render"`, instructs the browser not to render the page until the scriptsheet is loaded. React provides more fine-grained control using Suspense.
* `defer`: a string. Prevents the browser from executing the script until the document is done loading. Not compatible with streaming server-rendered components. Use the `async` prop instead.

#### Special rendering behavior

React can move `<script>` components to the document’s `<head>` and de-duplicate identical scripts.

To opt into this behavior, provide the `src` and `async={true}` props. React will de-duplicate scripts if they have the same `src`. The `async` prop must be true to allow scripts to be safely moved.

This special treatment comes with two caveats:

* React will ignore changes to props after the script has been rendered. (React will issue a warning in development if this happens.)
* React may leave the script in the DOM even after the component that rendered it has been unmounted. (This has no effect as scripts just execute once when they are inserted into the DOM.)

## Usage

### Rendering an external script

If a component depends on certain scripts in order to be displayed correctly, you can render a `<script>` within the component.
However, the component might be committed before the script has finished loading.
You can start depending on the script content once the `load` event is fired e.g. by using the `onLoad` prop.

React will de-duplicate scripts that have the same `src`, inserting only one of them into the DOM even if multiple components render it.

[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

```
import ShowRenderedHTML from './ShowRenderedHTML.js';

function Map({lat, long}) {
  return (
    <>
      <script async src="map-api.js" onLoad={() => console.log('script loaded')} />
      <div id="map" data-lat={lat} data-long={long} />
    </>
  );
}

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <ShowRenderedHTML>
      <Map />
    </ShowRenderedHTML>
  );
}
```

### Note

When you want to use a script, it can be beneficial to call the [preinit](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/preinit) function. Calling this function may allow the browser to start fetching the script earlier than if you just render a `<script>` component, for example by sending an [HTTP Early Hints response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/103).

### Rendering an inline script

To include an inline script, render the `<script>` component with the script source code as its children. Inline scripts are not de-duplicated or moved to the document `<head>`.

[Fork](https://codesandbox.io/api/v1/sandboxes/define?undefined&environment=create-react-app "Open in CodeSandbox")

```
import ShowRenderedHTML from './ShowRenderedHTML.js';

function Tracking() {
  return (
    <script>
      ga('send', 'pageview');
    </script>
  );
}

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <ShowRenderedHTML>
      <h1>My Website</h1>
      <Tracking />
      <p>Welcome</p>
    </ShowRenderedHTML>
  );
}
```
