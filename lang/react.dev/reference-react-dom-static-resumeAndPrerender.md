# resumeAndPrerender – React

[API Reference](https://react.dev/reference/react)

[Static APIs](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/static)

# resumeAndPrerender

`resumeAndPrerender` continues a prerendered React tree to a static HTML string using a [Web Stream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API).

```
const { prelude,postpone } = await resumeAndPrerender(reactNode, postponedState, options?)
```

* [Reference](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/static/resumeAndPrerender#reference) 
  + [`resumeAndPrerender(reactNode, postponedState, options?)`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/static/resumeAndPrerender#resumeandprerender)
* [Usage](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/static/resumeAndPrerender#usage) 
  + [Further reading](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/static/resumeAndPrerender#further-reading)

### Note

This API depends on [Web Streams.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API) For Node.js, use [`resumeAndPrerenderToNodeStream`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/static/resumeAndPrerenderToNodeStream) instead.

## Reference

### `resumeAndPrerender(reactNode, postponedState, options?)`

Call `resumeAndPrerender` to continue a prerendered React tree to a static HTML string.

```
import { resumeAndPrerender } from 'react-dom/static';

import { getPostponedState } from 'storage';

async function handler(request, response) {

const postponedState = getPostponedState(request);

const { prelude } = await resumeAndPrerender(<App />, postponedState, {

bootstrapScripts: ['/main.js']

});

return new Response(prelude, {

headers: { 'content-type': 'text/html' },

});

}
```

On the client, call [`hydrateRoot`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/client/hydrateRoot) to make the server-generated HTML interactive.

[See more examples below.](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/static/resumeAndPrerender#usage)

#### Parameters

* `reactNode`: The React node you called `prerender` (or a previous `resumeAndPrerender`) with. For example, a JSX element like `<App />`. It is expected to represent the entire document, so the `App` component should render the `<html>` tag.
* `postponedState`: The opaque `postpone` object returned from a [prerender API](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/static/index), loaded from wherever you stored it (e.g. redis, a file, or S3).
* **optional** `options`: An object with streaming options.
  + **optional** `signal`: An [abort signal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) that lets you [abort server rendering](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/static/resumeAndPrerender#aborting-server-rendering) and render the rest on the client.
  + **optional** `onError`: A callback that fires whenever there is a server error, whether [recoverable](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/static/resumeAndPrerender#recovering-from-errors-outside-the-shell) or [not.](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/static/resumeAndPrerender#recovering-from-errors-inside-the-shell) By default, this only calls `console.error`. If you override it to [log crash reports,](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/static/resumeAndPrerender#logging-crashes-on-the-server) make sure that you still call `console.error`.

#### Returns

`prerender` returns a Promise:

* If rendering the is successful, the Promise will resolve to an object containing:
  + `prelude`: a [Web Stream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API) of HTML. You can use this stream to send a response in chunks, or you can read the entire stream into a string.
  + `postponed`: an JSON-serializeable, opaque object that can be passed to [`resume`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/resume) or [`resumeAndPrerender`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/static/resumeAndPrerender) if `prerender` is aborted.
* If rendering fails, the Promise will be rejected. [Use this to output a fallback shell.](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToReadableStream#recovering-from-errors-inside-the-shell)

#### Caveats

`nonce` is not an available option when prerendering. Nonces must be unique per request and if you use nonces to secure your application with [CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP) it would be inappropriate and insecure to include the nonce value in the prerender itself.

### Note

### When should I use `resumeAndPrerender`?

The static `resumeAndPrerender` API is used for static server-side generation (SSG). Unlike `renderToString`, `resumeAndPrerender` waits for all data to load before resolving. This makes it suitable for generating static HTML for a full page, including data that needs to be fetched using Suspense. To stream content as it loads, use a streaming server-side render (SSR) API like [renderToReadableStream](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/renderToReadableStream).

`resumeAndPrerender` can be aborted and later either continued with another `resumeAndPrerender` or resumed with `resume` to support partial pre-rendering.

## Usage

### Further reading

`resumeAndPrerender` behaves similarly to [`prerender`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/static/prerender) but can be used to continue a previously started prerendering process that was aborted.
For more information about resuming a prerendered tree, see the [resume documentation](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/server/resume#resuming-a-prerender).
