# React Compiler – React

[Learn React](https://react.dev/learn)

# React Compiler

## Introduction

Learn [what React Compiler does](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/introduction) and how it automatically optimizes your React application by handling memoization for you, eliminating the need for manual `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `React.memo`.

## Installation

Get started with [installing React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation) and learn how to configure it with your build tools.

## Incremental Adoption

Learn [strategies for gradually adopting React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/incremental-adoption) in your existing codebase if you’re not ready to enable it everywhere yet.

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

When things don’t work as expected, use our [debugging guide](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/debugging) to understand the difference between compiler errors and runtime issues, identify common breaking patterns, and follow a systematic debugging workflow.

## Configuration and Reference

For detailed configuration options and API reference:

* [Configuration Options](https://react.dev/reference/react-compiler/configuration) - All compiler configuration options including React version compatibility
* [Directives](https://react.dev/reference/react-compiler/directives) - Function-level compilation control
* [Compiling Libraries](https://react.dev/reference/react-compiler/compiling-libraries) - Shipping pre-compiled libraries

## Additional resources

In addition to these docs, we recommend checking the [React Compiler Working Group](https://github.com/reactwg/react-compiler) for additional information and discussion about the compiler.
