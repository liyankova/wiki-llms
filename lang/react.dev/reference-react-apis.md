# Built-in React APIs

In addition to [Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks) and [Components](https://react.dev/reference/react/components), the `react` package exports a few other APIs that are useful for defining components. This page lists all the remaining modern React APIs.

---

* [`createContext`](https://react.dev/reference/react/createContext) lets you define and provide context to the child components. Used with [`useContext`.](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext)
* [`lazy`](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy) lets you defer loading a component’s code until it’s rendered for the first time.
* [`memo`](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo) lets your component skip re-renders with same props. Used with [`useMemo`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo) and [`useCallback`.](https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback)
* [`startTransition`](https://react.dev/reference/react/startTransition) lets you mark a state update as non-urgent. Similar to [`useTransition`.](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition)
* [`act`](https://react.dev/reference/react/act) lets you wrap renders and interactions in tests to ensure updates have processed before making assertions.

## Resource APIs

*Resources* can be accessed by a component without having them as part of their state. For example, a component can read a message from a Promise or read styling information from a context.

To read a value from a resource, use this API:

* [`use`](https://react.dev/reference/react/use) lets you read the value of a resource like a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) or [context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context).

```
function MessageComponent({ messagePromise }) {

const message = use(messagePromise);

const theme = use(ThemeContext);

// ...

}
```
