# Built-in React Components

React exposes a few built-in components that you can use in your JSX.

---

## Built-in components

* [`<Fragment>`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment), alternatively written as `<>...</>`, lets you group multiple JSX nodes together.
* [`<Profiler>`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Profiler) lets you measure rendering performance of a React tree programmatically.
* [`<Suspense>`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense) lets you display a fallback while the child components are loading.
* [`<StrictMode>`](https://react.dev/reference/react/StrictMode) enables extra development-only checks that help you find bugs early.
* [`<Activity>`](https://react.dev/reference/react/Activity) lets you hide and restore the UI and internal state of its children.

## Your own components

You can also [define your own components](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component) as JavaScript functions.
