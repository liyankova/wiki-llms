## Why Ship Compiled Code?

As a library author, you can compile your library code before publishing to npm. This provides several benefits:

* **Performance improvements for all users** - Your library users get optimized code even if they aren’t using React Compiler yet
* **No configuration required by users** - The optimizations work out of the box
* **Consistent behavior** - All users get the same optimized version regardless of their build setup

## Setting Up Compilation

Add React Compiler to your library’s build process:

Terminal

```
npm install -D babel-plugin-react-compiler@latest
```

Configure your build tool to compile your library. For example, with Babel:

```
// babel.config.js

module.exports = {

plugins: [

'babel-plugin-react-compiler',

],

// ... other config

};
```

## Backwards Compatibility

If your library supports React versions below 19, you’ll need additional configuration:

### 1. Install the runtime package

We recommend installing react-compiler-runtime as a direct dependency:

Terminal

```
npm install react-compiler-runtime@latest
```

```
{

"dependencies": {

"react-compiler-runtime": "^1.0.0"

},

"peerDependencies": {

"react": "^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0"

}

}
```

### 2. Configure the target version

Set the minimum React version your library supports:

```
{

target: '17', // Minimum supported React version

}
```

## Testing Strategy

Test your library both with and without compilation to ensure compatibility. Run your existing test suite against the compiled code, and also create a separate test configuration that bypasses the compiler. This helps catch any issues that might arise from the compilation process and ensures your library works correctly in all scenarios.

## Troubleshooting

### Library doesn’t work with older React versions

If your compiled library throws errors in React 17 or 18:

1. Verify you’ve installed `react-compiler-runtime` as a dependency
2. Check that your `target` configuration matches your minimum supported React version
3. Ensure the runtime package is included in your published bundle

### Compilation conflicts with other Babel plugins

Some Babel plugins may conflict with React Compiler:

1. Place `babel-plugin-react-compiler` early in your plugin list
2. Disable conflicting optimizations in other plugins
3. Test your build output thoroughly

### Runtime module not found

If users see “Cannot find module ‘react-compiler-runtime’“:

1. Ensure the runtime is listed in `dependencies`, not `devDependencies`
2. Check that your bundler includes the runtime in the output
3. Verify the package is published to npm with your library

## Next Steps

* Learn about [debugging techniques](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/debugging) for compiled code
* Check the [configuration options](https://react.dev/reference/react-compiler/configuration) for all compiler options
* Explore [compilation modes](https://react.dev/reference/react-compiler/compilationMode) for selective optimization
