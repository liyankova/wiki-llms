## [Introducing Bun v0.2.0](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.2.0#introducing-bun-v0-2-0)

[![https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709451/195575815-96df744a-1073-4292-b24d-5ba76c20b942.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709451/195575815-96df744a-1073-4292-b24d-5ba76c20b942.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709451/195575815-96df744a-1073-4292-b24d-5ba76c20b942.png)

New:

* `bun --hot` brings hot reloading & zero-downtime restarts to Bun's JavaScript runtime
* `Bun.spawn` and `Bun.spawnSync` (process spawning API)
* `Request.body` - incoming HTTP request body streaming with `ReadableStream`
* *tons* of bug fixes & reliability improvements to `Bun.serve` (HTTP server) and `fetch()` (HTTP client)
* Rewrote `setTimeout` and `setInterval` for better performance and reliability
* 2.7x+ lower memory usage for `Bun.serve` and anything using `Response` objects
* `"imports"` in package.json (`"#foo"` imports) works now https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/commit/21770eb0f31a43b3d6127ab957e271d029d6bc1b
* `"bun:test"` gets ~300x faster when using http server, websockets, etc https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/commit/524e48a81dfc6106ffcdd07b6fd035000b03146c
* Incrementally write files with `Bun.file(path).writer()`
* 30% faster Array.prototype.indexOf for strings (thanks @Constellation)
* 37% faster Array.prototype.map (thanks @Constellation)
* 1.4x - 4x faster String.prototype.substring (thanks @Constellation)
* 2.8x faster String.prototype.replace (thanks @Constellation)
* `new Blob(["hello world"])` is now [75x faster in Bun than Node](https://twitter.com/jarredsumner/status/1573204676782489600) - https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/commit/2c1926993bc4d94f9e7bc4d171217a707efd385c

Breaking:

* `bun run` and `bun` CLI arguments parsing has been changed so that anything after `bun run <file-or-script>` or `bun <file>` is passed through verbatim. This fixes a number of bugs with CLI argument parsing in both bun as a runtime and when used as a package.json `"scripts"` runner.

```
# before, server.js wouldn't see the --port argument
bun run server.js --port 3000
```

* `process.version` now reports a fake Node.js version instead of Bun's version. This is for compatibility with many npm packages that check for Node.js version to enable/disable features. To get Bun's version, use `Bun.version` or `process.versions.bun`.
* `Bun.serve().hostname` should return the hostname instead of the origin. This is a breaking change because it affects how URLs may be printed if you were using this getter before. https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/commit/e15fb6b9b220510df049e782d4f2f6eb3150d069

## [`bun --hot`: hot reloads on the server](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.2.0#bun-hot-hot-reloads-on-the-server)

`bun --hot` lets you see code changes immediately, without restarting your server. Unlike popular file watchers like nodemon, `bun --hot` preserves some of the state of your app, meaning in-flight HTTP requests don't get interrupted.

[![refresh speed comparison](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709451/195477632-5fd8a73e-014d-4589-9ba2-e075ad9eb040.gif)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709451/195477632-5fd8a73e-014d-4589-9ba2-e075ad9eb040.gif)

Bun on the left, Nodemon on the right

To use it with Bun's HTTP server (automatic):

```
// The global object is preserved across code reloads
// You can use it to store state, for now until Bun implements import.meta.hot.
const reloadCount = globalThis.reloadCount || 0;
globalThis.reloadCount = reloadCount + 1;

export default {
  fetch(req: Request) {
    return new Response(`Code reloaded ${reloadCount} times`, {
      headers: { "content-type": "text/plain" },
    });
  },
};
```

Then, run:

```
bun --hot server.ts
```

You can also use `bun run`:

```
bun run --hot server.ts
```

For more information, see `bun --hot` section in Bun's readme.

## [`Bun.spawn` spawn processes in Bun](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.2.0#bun-spawn-spawn-processes-in-bun)

`Bun.spawn` efficiently spawns a new process in Bun.

```
import { spawn } from "bun";

const { stdout } = await spawn(["echo", "hello world"]);
console.log(
  await new Response(
    // stdout is a ReadableStream
    stdout,
  ).text(),
); // "hello world"
```

`Bun.spawn` is flexible. `stdin` can be a `Response`, `Blob`, `Request`, `ArrayBuffer`, `ArrayBufferView`, `Bun.file`, `"pipe"` or `number`.

```
import { spawn } from "bun";

const { stdout } = spawn({
  cmd: ["esbuild"],
  // using fetch()
  stdin: await fetch(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oven-sh/bun/main/examples/hashing.js",
  ),
});

const text = await new Response(
  // stdout is a ReadableStream here
  stdout,
).text();
console.log(text.slice(0, 128), "..."); // const input = "hel...
```

`stdout` and `stderr` return `ReadableStream`s when `"pipe"` is used.

## [Request.body & Response.body return a `ReadableStream`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.2.0#request-body-response-body-return-a-readablestream)

This fixes https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/530

You can read `Request` & `Response` objects bodies as a ReadableStream now

## [`ReadableStream` now supports async iterators](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.2.0#readablestream-now-supports-async-iterators)

This works now:

```
const body = new Response(["hello"]).body;
const chunks = [];
for await (const chunk of body) {
  chunks.push(chunk);
}
```

Previously, you had to call `getReader()` like this:

```
const reader = body.getReader();
const chunks = [];
while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();
  if (done) {
    break;
  }
  chunks.push(value);
}
```

## [HTTP request body streaming](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.2.0#http-request-body-streaming)

`Bun.serve` now supports streaming request bodies. This is useful for large file uploads.

```
import { serve } from "bun";

serve({
  async fetch(req) {
    // body is a ReadableStream
    const body: ReadableStream = req.body;

    const id = `upload.${Date.now()}.txt`;
    const writer = Bun.file(id).writer();
    for await (const chunk of body) {
      writer.write(chunk);
    }
    const wrote = await writer.close();

    return Response.json({ wrote, id, type: req.headers.get("Content-Type") });
  },
});
```

## [`"imports"` support in `package.json`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.2.0#imports-support-in-package-json)

This release adds support for the [`imports` field in package.json](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#imports)

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709451/195571807-b2991da1-1b4c-406f-be79-8c2a9a3b076c.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709451/195571807-b2991da1-1b4c-406f-be79-8c2a9a3b076c.png)

## [Reduced memory usage for `Bun.serve()`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.2.0#reduced-memory-usage-for-bun-serve)

Bun wasn't correctly reporting memory usage for `Request`, `Response`, and `Blob` objects to JavaScriptCore, causing the garbage collector to be unaware of how much memory was really in use for http responses/requests.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709451/195571295-2a784d30-05b7-4fd2-bcb3-c82b6c70b37c.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709451/195571295-2a784d30-05b7-4fd2-bcb3-c82b6c70b37c.png)

## [`bun:test` performance improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.2.0#bun-test-performance-improvements)

An event loop bug in `bun:test` caused the process the idle for awhile. Now Bun's own http server tests run > 10x faster.
