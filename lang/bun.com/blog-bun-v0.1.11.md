### [In Bun v0.1.11, web framework libraries built on Bun got faster](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.1.11#in-bun-v0-1-11-web-framework-libraries-built-on-bun-got-faster)

[[![web frameworks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709451/188964804-9e2d1561-9b0c-4ffa-be24-593100cc2aea.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709451/188964804-9e2d1561-9b0c-4ffa-be24-593100cc2aea.png)](https://github.com/SaltyAom/bun-http-framework-benchmark)

## [Plugin API](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.1.11#plugin-api)

Bun's runtime now supports a plugin API.

* Import and require `.svelte`, `.vue`, `.yaml`, `.scss`, `.less` and other file extensions that Bun doesn't implement a builtin loader for
* Dynamically generate ESM & CJS modules

The API is loosely based on esbuild's plugin API.

This code snippet lets you import `.mdx` files in Bun:

```
import { plugin } from "bun";
import { renderToStaticMarkup } from "react-dom/server";

// Their esbuild plugin runs in Bun (without esbuild)
import mdx from "@mdx-js/esbuild";
plugin(mdx());

// Usage
import Foo from "./bar.mdx";
console.log(renderToStaticMarkup(<Foo />));
```

This lets you import `yaml` files:

```
import { plugin } from "bun";

plugin({
  name: "YAML",

  setup(builder) {
    const { load } = require("js-yaml");
    const { readFileSync } = require("fs");
    // Run this function on any import that ends with .yaml or .yml
    builder.onLoad({ filter: /\.(yaml|yml)$/ }, (args) => {
      // Read the YAML file from disk
      const text = readFileSync(args.path, "utf8");

      // parse the YAML file with js-yaml
      const exports = load(text);

      return {
        // Copy the keys and values from the parsed YAML file into the ESM module namespace object
        exports,

        // we're returning an object
        loader: "object",
      };
    });
  },
});
```

We're planning on supporting browser builds with this plugin API as well (run at transpilation time)

## [Reliability improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.1.11#reliability-improvements)

Node compatibility:

* feat: implement native os module by [@xHyroM](https://github.com/xHyroM) in https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/1115

* fix buffer.slice(0, 0) by [@zhuzilin](https://github.com/zhuzilin) in https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/1114
* Add buffer.indexOf, includes and lastIndexOf by [@zhuzilin](https://github.com/zhuzilin) in https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/1112
* Add native EventEmitter by [@zhuzilin](https://github.com/zhuzilin) in https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/1123
* Support emit Symbol events in EventEmitter by [@zhuzilin](https://github.com/zhuzilin) in https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/1129
* add SlowBuffer by [@zhuzilin](https://github.com/zhuzilin) in https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/1133
* update minified url polyfill by [@samfundev](https://github.com/samfundev) in https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/1132
* Add pad back to base64 by [@zhuzilin](https://github.com/zhuzilin) in https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/1140
* fix mkdtemp by [@zhuzilin](https://github.com/zhuzilin) in https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/1151
* Fix Buffer.isEncoding 39dc9899157d082841d79daa2f98dbecaa4efed6
* Implement `napi_add_finalizer` f023b89b732db0aff24445acbbe39c366d13118d
* `NAPI_MODULE_INIT()` wasn't implemented correctly in Bun and that has been fixed
* `import assert` and `import process` did not behave as expected (`assert` wasn't returning a function). This has been fixed
* `"node:module"`'s `createRequire` function wasn't requiring non-napi modules correctly

macOS event loop internals moved to a more reliable polling mechanism:

* **`setTimeout` CPU usage drops by 50%** https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/commit/c1734c6ec5ef709ee4126b3474c7bee0a377a1fa (Before: 90%, After: 33% - still more work to do here)
* on macOS, bun would sometimes hang due to race conditions (unrelated to network connection) if you ran `fetch` enough times in quick succession. The race conditions have been fixed.

* Fix `clearTimeout` on Linux e6a1209c53adb3056263b894d774b30ee70a3188

## [Performance improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.1.11#performance-improvements)

Bun has a long-term commitment to performance. On macOS, React server-side rendering gets around 2x faster.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709451/188825206-94183cbc-d900-4ca5-b6ac-5fc193311058.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709451/188825206-94183cbc-d900-4ca5-b6ac-5fc193311058.png)

Coming up next in performance improvements: a new HTTP server implementation. Not far enough along for this release, but experiments are [showing progress](https://twitter.com/jarredsumner/status/1565279541685153794).
