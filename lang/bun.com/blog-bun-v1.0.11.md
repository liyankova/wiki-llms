```

brew

```
brew tap oven-sh/bun
```

```
brew install bun
```

## [Bun.semver is a fast builtin SemVer parser](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.11#bun-semver-is-a-fast-builtin-semver-parser)

`bun install`'s fast node-semver compatible parser is now available as a builtin Bun API: `Bun.semver`.

```
import { semver } from "bun";

semver.satisfies("1.0.0", "^1.0.0"); // true
semver.satisfies("1.0.0", "^2.0.0"); // false

const versions = ["2.1.0", "1.0.0", "1.0.1", "1.1.0", "2.0.0", "2.0.1"];
versions.sort(semver.compare); // ["1.0.0", "1.0.1", "1.1.0", "2.0.0", "2.0.1", "2.1.0"]
```

It's 20x faster than `node-semver`, and passes `node-semver`'s test suite.

### [Fixed: Semver sorting bug with build tags](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.11#fixed-semver-sorting-bug-with-build-tags)

Previously, Bun was sorting semver versions incorrectly when build tags with multiple segments containing the `.` character were present. This has been fixed, thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway).

### [Fixed: `=` and `v` prefix in package.json versions](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.11#fixed-and-v-prefix-in-package-json-versions)

Previously, Bun only supported `=` and `v` prefixes in dependency versions, but not in `package.json` versions. This has been fixed, thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway).

## [Fixed: potential crash when printing exceptions](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.11#fixed-potential-crash-when-printing-exceptions)

A crash that has been present since before Bun v0.1.0 has been fixed. When displaying the preview of the source code that caused an exception, sometimes Bun would crash. This has been fixed.

## [Fixed: TLS handshaking error-handling issue](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.11#fixed-tls-handshaking-error-handling-issue)

A bug in `Bun.serve` that could cause Bun to eventually no longer respond to incoming requests with client-side certificates has been fixed, thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari).

## [A bug impacting `@google-cloud/storage` has been fixed](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.11#a-bug-impacting-google-cloud-storage-has-been-fixed)

A Node.js compatibilty bug caused `@google-cloud/storage` to not work as expected.

With `DEBUG="*"`, it would print a message like this:

```
  retry-request Current retry attempt: 1 +0ms
  retry-request Next retry delay: 2351 +221ms
  retry-request Current retry attempt: 2 +2s
  retry-request Next retry delay: 4143 +150ms
  retry-request Current retry attempt: 3 +4s
  retry-request Next retry delay: 8135 +185ms
  retry-request Current retry attempt: 4 +8s
TypeError: undefined is not an object
```

This has been fixed. It no longer errors, and it no longer erroneously retries (which would cause it to take a long time to fail).

## [A bug impacting Astro has been fixed](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.11#a-bug-impacting-astro-has-been-fixed)

A Node.js compatibility bug caused `astro dev` to return "file not found" errors when using Bun in v1.0.10. This has been fixed. We will soon add an integration test that runs Astro to prevent this from happening again.
