## [What's new](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.1.6#what-s-new)

* No more "Illegal Instruction" error on start for those using CPUs which don't support AVX/AVX2 instructions! Thanks to Bun's new `baseline` builds, these are separate builds of bun for Linux x64 and macOS x64 which do not use AVX/AVX2 instructions. You can install with the install script. This was one of the most common issues people ran into.
