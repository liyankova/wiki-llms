Bun v1.0.14 introduces `Bun.Glob`, a fast API for matching files and strings using glob patterns. It also fixes a race condition when extracting dependencies during `bun install`, improves TypeScript module resolution in `node_modules`, and makes error messages easier to read.

Bun is an incredibly fast JavaScript runtime, bundler, transpiler, and package manager — all in one. In case you missed it, here are some of the recent changes to Bun:

* [`v1.0.9`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.9) - Fixes a glibc symbol version error, illegal instruction error, a Bun.spawn bug, an edgecase with peer dependency installs, and a JSX transpiler bugfix
* [`v1.0.10`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.10) - Fixes 14 bugs (addressing 102 👍 reactions), node:http gets 14% faster, stability improvements to Bun for Linux ARM64, bun install bugfix, and node:http bugfixes
* [`v1.0.11`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.11) - Fixes 5 bugs, adds `Bun.semver`, fixes a bug in bun install and fixes bugs impacting `astro` and `@google-cloud/storage`
* [`v1.0.12`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.12) - Adds `bun -e` for evaluating scripts, `bun --env-file` for loading environment variables, `server.url`, `import.meta.env`, `expect.unreachable()`, improved CLI help output, and more
* [`v1.0.13`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.13) - Fixes 6 bugs (addressing 317 👍 reactions). 'http2' module & gRPC.js work now. Vite 5 & Rollup 4 work. Implements process.report.getReport(), improves support for ES5 'with' statements, fixes a regression in bun install, fixes a crash when printing exceptions, fixes a Bun.spawn bug, and fixes a peer dependencies bug

## [`Bun.Glob`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.14#bun-glob)

`Bun.Glob` is a fast API for matching files and strings using glob patterns.

It's similar to popular Node.js libraries like `fast-glob` or `micromatch`, except it matches strings 3x faster.

[![](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/assets/709451/0214879d-6fae-4857-8665-e77e6d838b74)](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/assets/709451/0214879d-6fae-4857-8665-e77e6d838b74)

Use `glob.scan()` to scan for files that match the glob, which returns an `AsyncIterator` that yields matching paths.

```
import { Glob } from "bun";

const glob = new Glob("**/*.ts");
for await (const path of glob.scan("src")) {
  console.log(path); // "src/index.ts"
}
```

Use `glob.match()` to match a string against a glob pattern.

```
import { Glob } from "bun";

const glob = new Glob("**/*.ts");

const match = glob.match("src/index.ts");
console.log(match); // true
```

Thanks to [@zackradisic](https://github.com/zackradisic) for implementing this! Also, thanks to [@mrmlnc](https://github.com/mrmlnc) for `fast-glob` along with the contributors to `micromatch` & `picomatch`, which our tests were inspired by. Much of our Zig implementation was inspired by Devon Govett (@devongovett) and Stephen Gregoratto (@The-King-of-Toasters)'s glob implementations, which we are grateful for.

## [Fixed bug with missing dependencies using `bun install`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.14#fixed-bug-with-missing-dependencies-using-bun-install)

Bun had a race condition that could cause `bun install` to occasionally fail to install a dependency when many different versions of the same package were being extracted concurrently. This was caused by a bug in how Bun created the temporary filename for installing dependencies. The path used was not unique enough, which could cause one build to overwrite another build's temporary folder, sometimes.

## [TypeScript module resolution changes in `node_modules`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.14#typescript-module-resolution-changes-in-node-modules)

To mimick `tsc` behavior, Bun loads TypeScript files before JavaScript files. This works well in local development, but sometimes npm packages ship TypeScript source files that transpilers cannot transpile, such as:

* TypeScript transformer plugins.
* Using `import {Foo}` instead of `import {type Foo}`.
* Using `export {Foo}` instead of `export {type Foo}`.

Going forward, when inside `node_modules`, Bun will prefer JavaScript files over TypeScript files when both are present.

This fixes errors that looked like:

```
SyntaxError: Indirectly exported binding name 'Foo' is not found.
```

Bun continues to support TypeScript files in `node_modules`. When both `.ts` and `.js` files are present, Bun will prefer the `.js` file when inside `node_modules`. Otherwise, Bun continues to prefer `.ts` files.

## [More readable error messages when a build fails](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.14#more-readable-error-messages-when-a-build-fails)

Bun now shows better error messages when a build fails:

* Fixed a bug where it only highlighed the first character
* Trimmed extraneous newlines in the error message
* Made the styling for build errors match the styling for runtime errors

## [Errors for unsupported ESM <> CommonJS features](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.14#errors-for-unsupported-esm-commonjs-features)

Bun supports both `require()` and `import` in the same file, but you cannot use import and `module.exports` in the same file. You also cannot use `exports`, `module`, `with`, or top-level return.

Previously, Bun relied on a runtime error message from JavaScriptCore for this, but the error message was a little confusing.

Now, these errors are detected at build-time and show a better error message. In this example, you cannot use `import` and `with` in the same file:

```
import "abc";

with (Bun) {
  write("/tmp/file.txt", escapeHTML(file("/tmp/file.html").text()));
  console.log({
    contents: file("/tmp/file.txt").text(),
  });
}
```

Before:

```
1 | import "abc";
2 |
3 | with (Bun) {
   ^
SyntaxError: Unexpected string literal "abc". import call expects one or two arguments.
      at unsupported.js:3:0
```

After:

```
1 | import "abc";
           ^
error: Cannot use import statement with CommonJS-only features
    at unsupported.js:1:8 7

note: Try require("abc") instead
note: This file is CommonJS because a "with" statement is used
```

## [Class name shown in `console.log`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.14#class-name-shown-in-console-log)

`console.log()` now shows the class name of the object in more cases, which matches the behavior of Node.js.

```
class Foo {}
class Bar {
  value = 1;
}

console.log(new Foo()); // Foo {}
console.log(new Bar()); // Bar { value: 1 }
```

Thanks to [@JibranKalia](https://github.com/JibranKalia) for implementing this!

## [Fixed signal using `process.kill()`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.14#fixed-signal-using-process-kill)

A bug was fixed where `SIGKILL` and `SIGSTOP` were not supported by `process.kill()`.

```
process.kill("SIGKILL"); // or "SIGSTOP"
```

If you encountered the following error, it is now fixed:

```
RangeError: Unknown signal name
```

Thanks to [@antongolub](https://github.com/antongolub) for fixing this bug!
