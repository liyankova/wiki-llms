# Bun v0.5

---

[Ashcon Partovi](https://twitter.com/ashconpartovi) · January 18, 2023

We're hiring [C/C++ and Zig engineers](https://bun.com/careers) to build the future of JavaScript!

Bun v0.5 is packed with new features including npm `workspaces`, `Bun.dns`, and support for `node:readline`. There's improved compatibility with `node:tls` and `node:net` so several database drivers now work in Bun for the first time, including Postgres.js, `mysql2`, `node-redis`, and others. Bun also continues to get faster and more stable — `Buffer` instantiation is 10x faster, `crypto.createHasher()` is 50x faster, and `bun install` got dozens of bugfixes.

```
# Install Bun
curl https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Upgrade to latest release of Bun
bun upgrade
```

## [Workspaces in `package.json`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.0#workspaces-in-package-json)

Bun now supports [`workspaces`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/workspaces?v=true#description) in `package.json`, and it's fast. Bun installs the [Remix](https://github.com/remix-run/remix) monorepo in about 500ms on Linux.

* 28x faster than `npm install`
* 12x faster than `yarn install` (v1)
* 8x faster than `pnpm install`

### [What are workspaces?](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.0#what-are-workspaces)

Workspaces make it easy to develop complex software as a *monorepo* consisting of several independent packages. To try it, specify a list of sub-packages in the `workspaces` field of your `package.json`; it's conventional to place these sub-packages in a directory called `packages`.

```
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "workspaces": ["packages/a", "packages/b"]
}
```

Bun doesn't support globs for workspace names yet, but this is coming soon!

This has a couple major benefits.

* **Code can be split into logical parts.** If one package relies on another, you can simply add it as a dependency with `bun add`. If package `b` depends on `a`, `bun install` will symlink your local `packages/a` directory into the `node_modules` folder of `b`, instead of trying to download it from the npm registry.
* **Dependencies can be de-duplicated.** If `a` and `b` share a common dependency, it will be *hoisted* to the root `node_modules` directory. This reduces redundant disk usage and minimizes "dependency hell" issues associated with having multiple versions of a package installed simultaneously.

## [`Bun.dns` and `node:dns`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.0#bun-dns-and-node-dns)

Bun can now resolve domain names using the built-in `Bun.dns` API. At the moment, `Bun.dns` exposes a single function: `lookup`.

```
import { dns } from "bun";

const records = await dns.lookup("example.com", { family: 4 });
console.log(records); // [{ address: "93.184.216.34" }]
```

We've also added a [minimal](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/1744) implementation of Node.js' [`node:dns`](https://nodejs.org/api/dns.html#dns) that uses `Bun.dns` under the hood. It's powered by [c-ares](https://c-ares.org/) and non-blocking `getaddrinfo` on MacOS.

```
import { resolve4 } from "node:dns/promises";

const records = await resolve4("example.com");
console.log(records); // [ "93.184.216.34" ]
```

## [Sockets using `node:tls` and `node:net`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.0#sockets-using-node-tls-and-node-net)

Bun now supports the creation of sockets using [`net.connect()`](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#netconnect) and [`tls.connect()`](https://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tlsconnectoptions-callback). This unblocks several database driver libraries. A handful of representative examples:

Connect to Postgres in Bun using **[Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres)** by [@porsager](https://github.com/porsager):

```
import postgres from "postgres";

const sql = postgres();
const [{ version }] = await sql`SELECT version()`;

console.log(version); // "PostgreSQL 14.2 ..."
```

Connect to MySQL in Bun using **[`mysql2`](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2)** client by [@sidorares](https://github.com/sidorares):

```
import { createConnection } from "mysql2/promise";

const connection = await createConnection({
  host: "localhost",
  user: "root",
  database: "test",
});

const [rows] = await connection.execute("SELECT 1+2 AS count");
console.log(rows); // [{ count: 3 }]
```

Connect to Redis from Bun using the official [Node.js client](https://github.com/redis/node-redis):

```
import { createClient } from "redis";

const client = createClient();
await client.connect();

await client.set("key", "Hello!");
const value = await client.get("key");

console.log(value); // "Hello!"
```

## [Support for `node:readline`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.0#support-for-node-readline)

Bulding CLI tools should be much easier now that Bun supports the [`node:readline`](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html#readline) module.

```
import * as readline from "node:readline/promises";

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout,
  terminal: true,
});

const answer = await rl.question("How fast is Bun from 1 to 10?\n");
if (parseInt(answer) > 10) {
  console.log("Good answer!");
}
```

Running this script yields:

```
bun readline.ts
```

```
How fast is Bun from 1 to 10?
```

```
11
```

```
Good answer!
```

## [Custom `headers` in `WebSocket`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.0#custom-headers-in-websocket)

A [long-standing](https://github.com/whatwg/websockets/issues/16) feature request on the `WebSocket` [spec](https://github.com/whatwg/websockets) is the ability to set custom headers when opening a WebSocket. While this hasn't yet landed in the WebSocket standard, Bun now implements it. This allows users to customize the headers used for the `WebSocket` client [handshake request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_servers#client_handshake_request).

```
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost/chat", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: "...",
  },
});
```

## [Improvements to `bun wiptest`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.0#improvements-to-bun-wiptest)

While `bun wiptest` is still a work in progress, we continue to increase Bun's compatibility with Jest.

### [`test.skip()`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.0#test-skip)

You can use [`test.skip()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/api#testskipname-fn) to skip unwanted tests.

```
import { describe, test, expect } from "bun:test";

describe("fetch()", () => {
  test.skip("can connect to localhost", async () => {
    const response = await fetch("http://localhost");
    expect(response.ok).toBe(true);
  });

  test("can connect to example.com", async () => {
    const response = await fetch("http://example.com");
    expect(response.ok).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

When you skip a test, it will appear as grayed out in the test output.

[![bun wiptest output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3238291/213013552-ec093bff-f070-46cb-a365-5f548346dd04.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3238291/213013552-ec093bff-f070-46cb-a365-5f548346dd04.png)

### [`expect(fn).toThrow()`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.0#expect-fn-tothrow)

You can use [`expect(fn).toThrow()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect#tothrowerror) to catch expected errors.

```
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("catch error", async () => {
  expect(() => {
    throw new Error();
  }).toThrow();
});
```

### [`describe` labels are included in the output](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.0#describe-labels-are-included-in-the-output)

Previously, nested `describe` labels were not included in the test runner output. Thanks to [@ethanburrell](https://github.com/ethanburrell), this has been fixed.

Before:

```
✓ outer > my test
```

After:

```
✓ outer > inner > my test
```

Test file:

```
import { describe, test } from "bun:test";

describe("outer", () => {
  describe("inner", () => {
    test("my test", () => {});
  });
});
```

## [Performance boosts](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.0#performance-boosts)

### [10x faster `new Buffer()`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.0#10x-faster-new-buffer)

Previously, the `Buffer` implementation in Bun was using [`Object.setPrototypeOf()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/setPrototypeOf#syntax) to create each new instance. Eliminating this bottleneck makes it 10x faster to instantiate a small [`Buffer`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer) in Bun.

[![10x faster Buffer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3238291/213013338-8b6c4e3c-3855-44cc-855e-3bfd455fc464.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3238291/213013338-8b6c4e3c-3855-44cc-855e-3bfd455fc464.png)

### [50x faster `crypto.createHash()`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.0#50x-faster-crypto-createhash)

Previously, Bun was using a pure JavaScript implementation of [`crypto.createHash()`](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#cryptocreatehashalgorithm-options). Now it's implemented using native code from [BoringSSL](https://github.com/boringssl/boringssl), yielding a 50x speed improvement.

## [Support for `HTTPS_PROXY`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.0#support-for-https-proxy)

Bun will now recognize the `HTTPS_PROXY`, `HTTP_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` enviroment variables when making outgoing HTTP requests, which includes [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) and `bun install`. These variables allow you to specify a proxy to forward, or not forward, certain HTTP requests and are useful when running Bun within a corporate firewall.

```
export HTTPS_PROXY="http://proxy.example.com:8080"
export NO_PROXY="localhost,noproxy.example.com"
```

If you want to learn more about these variables, GitLab wrote a nice [explainer](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/01/27/we-need-to-talk-no-proxy/).

## [Module resolution changes](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.0#module-resolution-changes)

There are two changes to module resolution that may impact a few packages.

1. Bun no longer checks the [`browser`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#browser) property in `package.json`. This is because some packages would disable Node.js functionality, which is not what we want for Bun.
2. For better Node.js & npm compatibility, Bun's JavaScript runtime now reads the `"node"` export condition in package.json [`exports`](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#exports).

The order Bun's JavaScript runtime reads package.json `"exports"` conditions is:

```
["bun", "worker", "module", "node", "browser", "default"];
```

This means that if a package has a `"node"` export condition, it will be used instead of the `"default"` or `"browser"` export condition.

## [Changelog](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.0#changelog)

While we continue to add new features to Bun, we're still focused on improving stability and fixing bugs. This release fixes a number of issues

### [Fixes to `bun install`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.0#fixes-to-bun-install)

Several bugs with Bun's package manager are fixed in this release, mostly by [@alexlamsl](https://github.com/alexlamsl). Thanks Alex!

| [`#1664`](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/1664) | Previously, scoped and private packages configured with `bun install` would have a registry of `localhost`, which made very little sense. We've fixed this and private registries will now default to the default registry if not specified, which is usually `registry.npmjs.org` |
| [`#1667`](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/1667) | Typically, npm clients are supposed to pass the `npm-auth-type` header, but `bun install` wasn't. We've fixed this and now `bun install` will pass the `npm-auth-type` header |
| [`a345efd`](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/commit/a345efd270bcd19672b13b363d287354113b7aba) | In some CI environments, like Vercel, linking `node_modules/.bin` would fail because the `/proc` filesystem (used to resolve absolute file paths) wasn't mounted. We've fixed this by falling back to `fchdir` and `getcwd` when `/proc/fd` is not available |
| [`385c81d`](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/commit/385c81d67be14abaaa938c0d7d46acd90d714392) | A crash sometimes happened when running `bun add <package>` if the `"dependencies"` list went from empty to not empty in a `package.json` |
| [`#1665`](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/1665) | Use `npm` as default registry when scopes are configured |
| [`#1671`](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/1671) | Fix logging verbosity in `bun install` |

[#### Bun v0.5.1](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.1)
