Bun v1.0.17 fixes 15 bugs (addressing 152 👍 reactions). `bun install` postinstall scripts run for top 500 packages, `bunx supabase` starts 30x faster than `npx supabase`, `bunx esbuild` starts 50x faster than `npx esbuild` and bugfixes to bun install

Bun is an incredibly fast JavaScript runtime, bundler, transpiler, and package manager — all in one. In case you missed it, here are some of the recent changes to Bun:

* [`v1.0.13`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.13) - Fixes 6 bugs (addressing 317 👍 reactions). 'http2' module & gRPC.js work now. Vite 5 & Rollup 4 work. Implements process.report.getReport(), improves support for ES5 'with' statements, fixes a regression in bun install, fixes a crash when printing exceptions, fixes a Bun.spawn bug, and fixes a peer dependencies bug
* [`v1.0.14`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.14) - `Bun.Glob`, a fast API for matching files and strings using glob patterns. It also fixes a race condition when extracting dependencies during `bun install`, improves TypeScript module resolution in `node_modules`, and makes error messages easier to read.
* [`v1.0.15`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.15) - Fixes 23 bugs (addressing 117 👍 reactions), `tsc` starts 2x faster. Stable `WebSocket` client, syntax-highlighted errors, cleaner stack traces, add custom test matchers with `expect.extend()` + additional expect matchers.
* [`v1.0.16`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.16) - Fixes 49 bugs (addressing 38 👍 reactions). Concurrent IO for Bun.file & Bun.write gets 3x faster and now supports Google Cloud Run & Vercel, Bun.write auto-creates the parent directory if it doesn't exist, `expect.extend` inside of preload works, `napi_create_object` gets 2.5x faster, bugfix for module resolution impacting Astro v4 and p-limit, console.log bugfixes

## [bun install now runs lifecycle scripts for the top 500 npm packages](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.17#bun-install-now-runs-lifecycle-scripts-for-the-top-500-npm-packages)

In this release, we've added the top 500 most-downloaded npm packages in [a default allowlist](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/blob/bun-v1.0.17/src/install/default-trusted-dependencies.txt#L1-L500) to run lifecycle scripts during `bun install`. This means that `bun install` will now run `preinstall`, `install`, and `postinstall` scripts for the top 500 npm packages which have them defined.

This addresses *many* issues with `bun install`:

Thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) and @paperclover for implementing this.

### [Lifecycle scripts now run in parallel](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.17#lifecycle-scripts-now-run-in-parallel)

As part of the above work, we also made lifecycle scripts run in parallel, which reduces the impact of lifecycle scripts on installation time.

⚙️ emoji appears when the lifecycle script is running

#### Configuring concurency

You can configure the maximum number of concurrent lifecycle scripts that run at once either by

`bunfig.toml`:

```
# Only run 5 in parallel at max
install.concurrentScripts = 5
```

CLI argument:

```
bun install --concurrent-scripts=5
```

Environment variable:

```
GOMAXPROCS=2 bun install
```

Note: it is `$GOMAXPROCS` because we use that elsewhere and it's one less environment variable for us to make up a name for (it's what Go uses, but Bun doesn't use Go).

## [Error message improvement in bun install](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.17#error-message-improvement-in-bun-install)

When a permissions error occurs, bun install now shows a more helpful error message. Instead of just "Unexpected", it now provides more information when it can.

### [Fixed: Semver pre-release sorting bug](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.17#fixed-semver-pre-release-sorting-bug)

A crash that could occur when sorting many pre-release versions of specific input simultaneously has been fixed. This bug was fixed by [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway). This bug could be reproduced when installing 4 year old versions of Gatsby.

### [Fixed: lifecycle script dependency install order](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.17#fixed-lifecycle-script-dependency-install-order)

A bug where `bun install` would install lifecycle scripts without first ensuring all dependent lifecycle scripts were installed has been fixed. This bug was fixed by [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway).

## [`bunx supabase` starts 30x faster than `npx supabase`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.17#bunx-supabase-starts-30x-faster-than-npx-supabase)

Since `bun install` now enables lifecycle scripts for popular packages by default, `bunx supabase` now works.

On Linux x64, `bun x supabase` starts 30x faster than `npx supabase`:

```
Benchmark 1: bun x supabase
  Time (mean ± σ):      10.5 ms ±   1.0 ms    [User: 8.0 ms, System: 5.5 ms]
  Range (min … max):     8.5 ms …  13.1 ms    248 runs

Benchmark 2: npx supabase
  Time (mean ± σ):     325.2 ms ±  30.6 ms    [User: 272.6 ms, System: 117.9 ms]
  Range (min … max):   291.0 ms … 389.9 ms    10 runs

Summary
  bun x supabase ran
   30.90 ± 4.17 times faster than npx supabase
```

## [`bunx esbuild` starts 50x faster than `npx esbuild`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.17#bunx-esbuild-starts-50x-faster-than-npx-esbuild)

Now that `bun install` enables lifecycle scripts for popular packages by default, `bunx esbuild` now starts roughly 50x faster than `npx esbuild`:

```
Benchmark 1: bun x esbuild --help
  Time (mean ± σ):       3.5 ms ±   0.3 ms    [User: 1.8 ms, System: 1.6 ms]
  Range (min … max):     2.8 ms …   4.3 ms    827 runs

Benchmark 2: npx esbuild --help
  Time (mean ± σ):     295.7 ms ±  23.8 ms    [User: 270.0 ms, System: 100.6 ms]
  Range (min … max):   259.6 ms … 339.6 ms    10 runs

Summary
  bun x esbuild --help ran
   83.84 ± 9.31 times faster than npx esbuild --help
```

## [`-h` is now an alias of `--help`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.17#h-is-now-an-alias-of-help)

`-h` is now an alias of `--help` for all commands. Thanks to [@hustLer2k](https://github.com/hustLer2k) for implementing this.

```
$ bun -h
