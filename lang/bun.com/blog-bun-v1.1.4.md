### [bun install fixes](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#bun-install-fixes)

## [`bun --filter` runs workspace scripts in parallel](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#bun-filter-runs-workspace-scripts-in-parallel)

Say you have a monorepo with two packages: `packages/api` and `packages/frontend`, both with a `dev` script that will start a local development server.

Normally, you would have to open two separate terminal tabs, cd into each package directory, and run `bun dev`:

Using `--filter`, you can run the `dev` script in both packages at once, using glob patterns to filter which projects to run the script in:

```
bun --filter='*' dev
```

Both commands will be run in parallel, and you will see a nice terminal UI showing their respective outputs:

[![](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/assets/48869301/2a103e42-9921-4c33-948f-a1ad6e6bac71)](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/assets/48869301/2a103e42-9921-4c33-948f-a1ad6e6bac71)

You can pass multiple filters to `--filter`:

```
bun --filter 'packages/api' --filter 'packages/frontend' dev
```

You can think of this as a more powerful replacement for `npm run --workspace <workspace> <script>`.

Thanks to pnpm for the inspiration, and to [@gvilums](https://github.com/gvilums) for implementing this feature.

## [Up to 50% faster reinstalls in `bun install`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#up-to-50-faster-reinstalls-in-bun-install)

When dependencies in `node_modules` have to be reinstalled (for example, because the version on-disk is different), bun install is now up to 50% faster.

In a repository with 450 MB of `node_modules` on a Macbook Pro M3:

```
❯ hyperfine "bun install --ignore-scripts" "bun-1.1.3 install --ignore-scripts" --prepare="rm -rf node_modules/**/package.json" --warmup=2
Benchmark 1: bun install --ignore-scripts
  Time (mean ± σ):     501.6 ms ±  15.6 ms    [User: 18.0 ms, System: 1174.0 ms]
  Range (min … max):   491.1 ms … 543.8 ms    10 runs

Benchmark 2: bun-1.1.3 install --ignore-scripts
  Time (mean ± σ):     771.4 ms ±  13.4 ms    [User: 13.9 ms, System: 616.6 ms]
  Range (min … max):   756.0 ms … 800.4 ms    10 runs

Summary
  bun install --ignore-scripts ran
    1.54 ± 0.05 times faster than bun-1.1.3 install --ignore-scripts
```

We moved deleting the old package's files to a separate thread to speed up the wall-clock time and reduce blocking I/O on the main thread.

## [Fixed: Hoisting aliased packages](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#fixed-hoisting-aliased-packages)

Bun was not hoisting aliased npm packages before. This meant we would install the same aliased packages multiple times in `node_modules` unnecessarily.

This has been fixed, thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway).

## [Fixed: Sometimes flaky `bun install` in CI environments](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#fixed-sometimes-flaky-bun-install-in-ci-environments)

A bug that could cause `bun install` to fail in CI environments sporadically has been fixed.

The code that waited for dependencies in `node_modules` of dependencies within a child `node_modules` folder was not correctly always waiting for the parent to finish installing before installing the children. This led to potentially creating the parent dependencies folder in node\_modules, installing the package, and then deleting it.

This bug manifested most frequently when installing many different versions of the same package simultaneously when there was no cached version available on disk. For example, this bug could cause `string-width` to potentially throw an `ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` when used in Node.js.

Thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) for fixing this.

### [Node.js compatibility improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#node-js-compatibility-improvements)

## [fs.close() callback is optional](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#fs-close-callback-is-optional)

Previously, the following code would work in Node.js but not in Bun:

```
import fs from "fs";

fs.open("file.txt", "r", (err, fd) => {
  // missing the callback in the 2nd argument!
  fs.close(fd);
});
```

Now, the callback is optional in Bun as well.

Thanks to [@gvilums](https://github.com/gvilums) for fixing this.

## [fs.writeFile(fd, data) should not truncate](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#fs-writefile-fd-data-should-not-truncate)

In Node.js, when `fs.writeFile` is called with a file descriptor, it does not truncate the file. When called with a path, it does.

Previously in Bun, `fs.writeFile` would truncate the file when called with a file descriptor or a path. This has been fixed to now match Node.js behavior and only truncate when called with a path.

```
import { writeFile } from "fs/promises";
import { openSync } from "fs";

const fd = openSync("file.txt", "w");
await writeFile(fd, "hello"); // does not truncate
await writeFile("file.txt", "hello"); // truncates
```

Thanks to [@gvilums](https://github.com/gvilums) for fixing this.

## [FileHandle#appendFile appends](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#filehandle-appendfile-appends)

In Node.js, `FileHandle#appendFile` appends to the file. Previously in Bun, it would truncate the file before appending. This has been fixed.

```
import { open } from "fs/promises";

const file = await open("file.txt", "a");
await file.appendFile("hello"); // appends
```

### [bun:sqlite improvmeents](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#bun-sqlite-improvmeents)

## [New: `using` Database & Statement](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#new-using-database-statement)

The `using` syntax is now supported for `Database` and `Statement` objects in bun:sqlite. This syntax will automatically call `Database#close` and `Statement#finalize` when the scope ends.

```
import { Database } from "bun:sqlite";

{
  // Automatically close the Database at the end of this scope
  using db = new Database("file.db");

  // Automatically finalize the statement at the end of this scope.
  using query = db.query("SELECT * FROM users");
  for (const row of query.all()) {
    console.log(row);
  }
}
```

`using` is part of the stage3 TC39 proposal [Explicit Resource Management](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management).

## [New: `Database#fileControl` method](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#new-database-filecontrol-method)

The low-level [`sqlite3_file_control`](https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/file_control.html) method is now exposed in bun:sqlite as `Database#fileControl`.

```
import { Database, constants } from "bun:sqlite";

const db = new Database();
// Ensure WAL mode is NOT persistent
// this prevents wal files from lingering after the database is closed
db.fileControl(constants.SQLITE_FCNTL_PERSIST_WAL, 0);
```

## [New: `Database#close(throwOnError: boolean = false)` argument](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#new-database-close-throwonerror-boolean-false-argument)

You can now pass a `throwOnError` argument to `Database#close` to throw an error if the database cannot be closed for any reason.

```
import { Database, constants } from "bun:sqlite";

const db = new Database();
const query = db.query("SELECT * FROM users");
db.close(true); // "Database is locked"
db.close(false); // no error, stop new queries from being created
```

Internally, when `throwOnError` is true, `sqlite3_close` is called instead of `sqlite3_close_v2`.

This is not a breaking change because previously `close` did not accept any arguments, and the behavior remains the same if no arguments are passed. The argument defaults to false.

## [Fixed: Close database when garbage collected](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#fixed-close-database-when-garbage-collected)

When the `Database` object gets garbage collecte due to no longer being in use, the `Database` will now be closed in sqlite automatically.

Previously, bun:sqlite would only close databases automatically on process exit. This was not good enough.

## [Fixed: Bug with binding to duplicate column names in JOIN](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#fixed-bug-with-binding-to-duplicate-column-names-in-join)

A longstanding bug related to duplicate column names in JOIN queries when using bun:sqlite has been fixed.

```
import { Database } from "bun:sqlite";

const db = new Database();

db.query(
  "CREATE TABLE Users (Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, Name VARCHAR(255));",
).run();

db.query(
  "CREATE TABLE Cars (Id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, Driver INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY (Driver) REFERENCES Users(Id))",
).run();

db.query('INSERT INTO Users (Id, Name) VALUES (1, "Alice");').run();
db.query("INSERT INTO Cars (Id, Driver) VALUES (1, 1);").run();

const car = db.query("SELECT * FROM Cars JOIN Users ON Driver=Users.Id").get();

console.log(car);

db.close();
```

Previously, the above code would incorrectly log:

```
{
  Id: 1,
  Driver: 1,
  Name: 1,
}
```

Now, it correctly logs:

```
{
  Driver: 1,
  Id: 1,
  Name: "Alice",
}
```

This matches the behavior of the popular `better-sqlite3` package.

Thanks to [@gvilums](https://github.com/gvilums) for fixing this, and to [@Hanaasagi](https://github.com/Hanaasagi) for the initial investigation.

### [Bundows improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#bundows-improvements)

## [`windowsHide` & `windowsVerbatimArguments`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#windowshide-windowsverbatimarguments)

The Node.js `child_process` API supports the `windowsHide` and `windowsVerbatimArguments` options. These options are now supported in Bun as well, thanks to [@nektro](https://github.com/nektro).

## [Bun.serve() extra byte](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#bun-serve-extra-byte)

A bug where Bun.serve() could potentially send an extra byte of duplicated data with certain input has been fixed, thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari).

This regression started in Bun v1.1.1 and we've improved our test coverage to prevent this from happening again.

## [Bun.which() case-insensitive file extension](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#bun-which-case-insensitive-file-extension)

On Windows, filenames are generally case-insensitive. Bun.which() now also matches case-insensitive file extensions on Windows. This means you can open `cmd.EXE` as well as `cmd.exe` (and all other permutations of case) on Windows.

## [`--cwd` flag works on Windows](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#cwd-flag-works-on-windows)

The `--cwd` flag now works as expected on Windows.

```
bun --cwd=.\my-app run hey
```

This changes the current working directory to `.\my-app` before running the `hey` script. This saves you from having to `cd` into the directory before running the script.

### [Runtime improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#runtime-improvements)

## [New: `AbortSignal.any`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#new-abortsignal-any)

Bun now supports [`AbortSignal.any`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal/any_static), which lets you create a new `AbortSignal` that is aborted when any of the passed `AbortSignal` are signaled. It's sort of like `Promise.race` for `AbortSignal`s.

```
const first = new AbortController().signal;
const second = new AbortController().signal;
fetch("https://example.com", {
  signal: first,
});
fetch("https://example.com", {
  signal: second,
});

const abortSignal = AbortSignal.any([first, second]);

// Cancel this when either `first` or `second` is aborted
await fetch("https://example.com/slow", { signal: abortSignal });
```

This code comes directly from WebKit/Safari, so thanks to the WebKit team for implementing this feature.

## [Fixed: Memory leak in Web Streams impacting Next.js](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#fixed-memory-leak-in-web-streams-impacting-next-js)

A memory leak in Web Streams has been fixed. This bug could cause Next.js Standalone to leak memory when responding to requests.

Thanks to [@lithdew](https://github.com/lithdew) for fixing this.

## [Fixed: fetch() "Connection closed" bug](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#fixed-fetch-connection-closed-bug)

Some servers rely on TLS v1.2 renegotiation, which lets a server change how it authenticates a client after the connection has been established. This was deprecated in TLS v1.3, but many servers still use it. Previously, when encountering a server that used TLS renegotiation, Bun would throw a "Connection closed" error. We now allow TLS renegotiation for clients, but continue to not allow it for servers. For servers, TLS renegotiation is a DoS attack vector, BoringSSL does not support it, and is generally not recommended.

This bug sometimes manifested as receiving a `Connection closed` error when using `fetch()` in Bun.

Thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari) for fixing this, and to [@lithdew](https://github.com/lithdew) for narrowing down the issue.

## [Fixed: escaped newlines in shell commands](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.4#fixed-escaped-newlines-in-shell-commands)

A bug where escaped newlines in shell commands did not match bash's behavior has been fixed, thanks to [@zackradisic](https://github.com/zackradisic). This bug impacted `bun run` on Windows as well as `Bun.$` at runtime. Thanks to [@zackradisic](https://github.com/zackradisic) for fixing this.
