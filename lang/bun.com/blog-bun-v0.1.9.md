To upgrade:

```
bun upgrade
```

To install:

```
curl https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

If you have any problems upgrading

Run the install script (you can run it multiple times):

```
curl https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

## [What's new](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.1.9#what-s-new)

* Numerous crashes fixed by [@zhuzilin](https://github.com/zhuzilin)!! Incredible work.
* [Linux] Improved event loop reliability and reduced CPU usage for concurrent/async IO (affects `bun install` and `fetch()` mostly)
* `Bun.serve` gets about 20% faster outside of "hello world" benchmarks due to optimizing how `Headers` are copied/read and faster generated bindings
* `require("buffer")` and `require("process")` now point to Bun's implementation instead of a browserify polyfill (thanks @zhuzilin)
* Fixed a bug that would cause `setTimeout` or `setInterval` to not keep the process alive (thanks @zhuzilin)
* Updated to latest WebKit
* 6x - 10x faster `ptr()` in `bun:ffi`

JIT-optimized `TextEncoder.encodeInto` can be a 1.5x perf boost up to around a 5x perf boost

The `hash()` function in this microbenchmark calls `ptr()`:

## [Internals](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.1.9#internals)

#### Bun learns how to JIT

`DOMJIT` is a JavaScriptCore API that gives 3rd-party embedders low-level access to the JIT compiler/assembler to optimize native functions and getters/setters. Safari leverages DOMJIT to make commonly-accessed properties like `element.parentNode` faster

Bun is beginning to use DOMJIT now, starting in two places:

* `ptr()` function in `bun:ffi`
* [`TextEncoder.encodeInto`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextEncoder/encodeInto)

To better support Bun's usecase, I extended `DOMJIT` to support Typed Array arguments, as well as added support for specifying more kinds of side effects that enable/disable optimizations:

* https://github.com/oven-sh/WebKit/commit/d2ef2fd828761778a3b04289563946354a457e29
* https://github.com/oven-sh/WebKit/commit/3262da8fd77667aaf95e75c7efa501dc135bc0ac
* https://github.com/oven-sh/WebKit/commit/4ac5b04047a53ce2363495a79770a2ae6d67761b#diff-90a5d15b3faae39b6e5075902ae5fd2e0b7f7f40bb0590f3e298e7715db048e5

#### Faster and more reliable JSC <> Zig bindings

At Bun's compile-time, Bun now code-generates C++ binding classes for JavaScript objects implemented in Zig. Previously, Bun mostly used the JavaScriptCore C API.

Using JavaScriptCore's C++ API improves performance and is important for making the garbage collector better aware of Bun's usage. But, writing bindings manually can be very repetitive.

Given a class definition in JavaScript [like this](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/blob/eb5b298bc17a7ea2ede438b227c27c3fc0b5462e/src/bun.js/webcore/response.classes.ts#L60-L65):

```
define({
  name: "Response",
  construct: true,
  finalize: true,
  JSType: "0b11101110",
  klass: {
    json: {
      fn: "constructJSON",
    },
    // rest of the code
  },
  proto: {
    url: {
      getter: "getURL",
      cache: true,
    },

    text: { fn: "getText" },
    json: { fn: "getJSON" },
    arrayBuffer: { fn: "getArrayBuffer" },
    blob: { fn: "getBlob" },
    clone: { fn: "doClone", length: 1 },
    // rest of the code
  },
});
```

Bun generates corresponding:

* [C++ classes](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/blob/eb5b298bc17a7ea2ede438b227c27c3fc0b5462e/src/bun.js/bindings/ZigGeneratedClasses.cpp#L2465-L2872)
* [Zig bindings](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/blob/eb5b298bc17a7ea2ede438b227c27c3fc0b5462e/src/bun.js/bindings/generated_classes.zig#L826-L937) with type checks that verify the expected ABI matches

This approach is inspired by [WebIDL bindings](https://www.chromium.org/developers/web-idl-interfaces/) which both Safari and Chromium use.

#### More reliable event loop on Linux

Previously, bun had a tendency to hang in situations like this
