## [1st-class S3 support](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#1st-class-s3-support)

This release introduces 1st-class S3 Object Storage support in Bun.

Modern user-facing production servers frequently choose to store files in S3-like object storage services instead of the local POSIX filesystem. Decoupling storage capacity from compute capacity prevents an entire class of production reliability issues: low disk space, high p95 response times related to file system i/o, security issues related to persistent storage.

S3 is a de-facto standard that predates ES6 by a decade. The POSIX filesystem API was never designed for the internet age (non-blocking regular files aren't a thing! It's crazy!).

Bun's S3 API is designed to be feel similar to the web's `Response` and `Blob` APIs (like Bun's local filesystem APIs).

```
import { s3, write, S3Client } from "bun";

// Bun.s3 reads environment variables for credentials
// file() returns a lazy reference to a file on S3
const metadata = s3.file("123.json");

// Download from S3
const data = await metadata.json();
const text = await metadata.text();
const arrayBuffer = await metadata.arrayBuffer();
const uint8array = await metadata.bytes();

// Upload to S3
await metadata.write(JSON.stringify({ name: "John", age: 30 }));
await metadata.write(Bun.file("./123.json"));

// Presign a URL (synchronous - no network request needed)
const url = metadata.presign({
  acl: "public-read",
  expiresIn: 60 * 60 * 24, // 1 day
});

// Delete the file
await metadata.delete();
```

We added this API to Bun because many servers don't use `fs`, they use S3.

You can use Bun's S3 client with any S3-compatible object storage service, such as:

* AWS S3
* Google Cloud Storage
* DigitalOcean Spaces
* Cloudflare R2
* Backblaze B2
* MinIO
* ...and more

Learn more about Bun's S3 API [in the docs](https://bun.sh/docs/api/s3).

## [HTML Bundler](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#html-bundler)

Bun now natively supports bundling HTML files along with their associated JavaScript, CSS, and assets. This makes it easier to build static sites and web applications with Bun.

```
bun build --experimental-html --experimental-css ./index.html --outdir=dist
```

> In the next version of Bun  
>   
> bun build supports bundling assets, JS, and CSS from .html files [pic.twitter.com/5VpweY1HMn](https://t.co/5VpweY1HMn)
>
> — Jarred Sumner (@jarredsumner) [December 22, 2024](https://twitter.com/jarredsumner/status/1870797521993539813?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

This bundles stylesheets, JavaScript, and all other assets. Multiple nested levels of JavaScript `import` and `require` get bundled into one file. CSS files are parsed and concatenated into one file (whether using `@import` or multiple `<link>` tags).

In Bun v1.2, we'll remove the `--experimental-html` and `--experimental-css` flags and they'll be enabled by default.

## [`bun install --filter <pattern>`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#bun-install-filter-pattern)

`bun install` gets `--filter` support. This lets you selectively install workspace packages within your monorepo.

[![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5579693c-1572-4e9f-9b30-2b2c463c128f)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5579693c-1572-4e9f-9b30-2b2c463c128f)

Thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) for implementing this!

## [V8 Heap Snapshots](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#v8-heap-snapshots)

Bun now supports outputting V8 heap snapshots. This lets you use Chrome DevTools to inspect the heap of your Bun application. This wasn't previously possible before because Bun doesn't use V8 as the JavaScript engine. Bun uses JavaScriptCore. To make this work, we've added support for this in our fork of WebKit/JavaScriptCore.

Relatedly, we've also added support for `v8.writeHeapSnapshot` and `v8.getHeapSnapshot` in `node:v8`.

```
import { writeHeapSnapshot, getHeapSnapshot } from "node:v8";
const path = writeHeapSnapshot();
console.log(path); // Outputs the path to the generated heap snapshot

const snapshot = await Bun.file(path).json();
console.log(snapshot); // Outputs the parsed heap snapshot data
```

> In the next version of Bun  
>   
> Bun.generateHeapSnapshot("v8") outputs V8's .heapsnapshot format, so you can use Chrome DevTools and VSCode to debug memory usage [pic.twitter.com/veIBqASLoi](https://t.co/veIBqASLoi)

## [Errors show more properties](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#errors-show-more-properties)

Previously, Bun hardcoded a small list of properties to display when printing top-level errors. Now we print all the own properties of the error.

Fixed:

```
❯ bun such.js
1 | const err = new Error("An example error");
                ^
error: An example error
  wow: "wow",
 such: "property",
 very: "information",

      at <file>.js:1:13
```

Previously, Bun would not show properties like `wow`, `such`, or `very` when displaying errors. Now it shows everything defined on the error object directly.

```
❯ bun-1.1.42 such.js
1 | const err = new Error("An example error");
                ^
error: An example error
      at <file>.js:1:13
```

## [bun run](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#bun-run)

### [`-F` is for `--filter`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#f-is-for-filter)

`bun run --filter='*pkg' <script>` now supports the `-F` shorthand

```
bun run -F=<pattern> <script>
bun run --filter=<pattern> <script>
bun -F <pattern> <script>
bun -F=<pattern> <script>
```

### [`--elide-lines=N` controls filter output line length](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#elide-lines-n-controls-filter-output-line-length)

The `--elide-lines` option in `bun run --filter` controls the number of output lines displayed when interactively running scripts in a terminal. This helps avoid missing errors in long scripts, while still showing the output of the script.

```
bun run --filter ./packages/dep0 --elide-lines=5 script
```

Thanks to [@martinamps](https://github.com/martinamps) for implementing this!

### [`pnpx` and `pnpm dlx` auto-replacement](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#pnpx-and-pnpm-dlx-auto-replacement)

When you use `bun run` to run package.json scripts, we swap out `yarn run`, `npm run`, and `pnpm run` with `bun run` (so that you don't have to update your package.json). Now we also replace `pnpx` and `pnpm dlx` with `bunx`.

Thanks to [@pfgithub](https://github.com/pfgithub) for implementing this!

## [bun install](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#bun-install)

### [New: slow postinstall script logging](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#new-slow-postinstall-script-logging)

Buggy postinstall scripts on npm can cause your install to hang.

To help identify the package causing the hang, `bun install` now logs the package name of any postinstall scripts that takes longer than 30 seconds to run.

If you run `bun install` with `--verbose`, it will log the package name every 2 seconds instead of every 30 seconds.

### [New: `bundle(d)Dependencies` in `bun install`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#new-bundle-d-dependencies-in-bun-install)

Bun now supports handling `bundle(d)Dependencies` in the `bun install` command. This update allows users to specify dependencies that should be bundled together, streamlining package management. This makes it easier for users to create consistent and manageable projects, especially when dealing with multiple dependencies.

Thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) for implementing this!

### [New: `--lockfile-only` option for bun install](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#new-lockfile-only-option-for-bun-install)

You can now use the `--lockfile-only` option with the `bun install` command to generate a lockfile without installing any dependencies. This is useful when you want to update or create a lockfile based on your `package.json` without affecting the state of your `node_modules` directory.

[![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcad5a9b-1a05-475c-978a-fe0ed0c294d1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fcad5a9b-1a05-475c-978a-fe0ed0c294d1)

Thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) for implementing this!

### [New: `--peer` option in `bun add`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#new-peer-option-in-bun-add)

You can now add a package as a peer dependency using the `--peer` option with the `bun add` command. This functionality allows users to specify peer dependencies directly from their terminal, enhancing the usability of package management in Bun.

```
bun add --peer @types/bun
```

Thanks to [@riskymh](https://github.com/riskymh) for implementing this!

### [Fixed: bun.lock file permissions](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#fixed-bun-lock-file-permissions)

Bun's text-based lockfile was being marked as world-writable and executable, which was unnecessary.

This has been fixed, thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway)!

### [Fixed: `install.cache.dir` in bunfig.toml](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#fixed-install-cache-dir-in-bunfig-toml)

The `install.cache.dir` option now correctly reads the cache directory from your `bunfig.toml`. This change ensures that the cache directory can be customized through your configuration.

```
[install]
cache.dir = "./your_custom_cache_directory"
```

Thanks to [@chawyehsu](https://github.com/chawyehsu) for implementing this!

### [Fixed: crash in `bun patch --commit`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#fixed-crash-in-bun-patch-commit)

A crash in `bun patch --commit` has been fixed, thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway)!

### [Fixed: quote-escaping in `bun.lock` package names](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#fixed-quote-escaping-in-bun-lock-package-names)

Invalid `"name"` fields in package.json files were being persisted in the `bun.lock` file without escaping the quote character. This has been fixed, thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway)!

## [Node.js compatibility improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#node-js-compatibility-improvements)

### [100% of `node:path` tests now pass](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#100-of-node-path-tests-now-pass)

Bun's `node:path` module now passes 100% of Node.js' test suite.

#### Fixed: potential crash when joining long win32 paths in `node:path`

A crash that could occur when joining very long paths using the `node:path` module has been fixed, thanks to [@DonIsaac](https://github.com/DonIsaac)!

### [98.08% of `node:zlib` tests now pass](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#98-08-of-node-zlib-tests-now-pass)

All but 1 test in the `node:zlib` module now pass.

Thanks to [@nektro](https://github.com/nektro) for this!

#### Fixed: memory leak in node:zlib

A memory leak in the `node:zlib` module has been fixed. This particularly impacted Brotli compression.

#### Fixed: zlib dictionary option handling

The `dictionary` option in `zlib` now works as expected. This fixed an issue impacting some Minecraft servers using Bun.

```
const deflate = zlib.createDeflate({ dictionary: Buffer.from("...") });
```

### [Fixed: napi\_set\_last\_error method in Node-API](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#fixed-napi-set-last-error-method-in-node-api)

The `napi_set_last_error` method in Node-API now sets an appropriate error code prior to returning. Previously, we were not consistently setting the error code prior to returning from Node-API functions - which caused some native addons to not receive the correct error code after a failed function call.

Thanks to [@190n](https://github.com/190n) for implementing this!

### [Fixed: `process.kill` allows zero or negative PIDs](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#fixed-process-kill-allows-zero-or-negative-pids)

An incorrect validation was preventing `process.kill` from accepting negative PIDs. Negative PIDs let you kill an entire process group instead of just a single process.

```
const { spawn, exec } = require("child_process");

// Starting a process
const child = spawn("some-command");

// Killing the process using a negative PID
process.kill(-child.pid);
```

Thanks to [@nektro](https://github.com/nektro) for implementing this!

### [`--expose-gc` flag adds `globalThis.gc`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#expose-gc-flag-adds-globalthis-gc)

Bun now implements the Node.js `--expose-gc` CLI flag, alongside the `Bun.gc()` method. This CLI flag adds `gc` to the global scope, which allows you to manually trigger garbage collection in your code.

```
bun --expose-gc <script.js>
```

The `Bun.gc()` method is the same as `globalThis.gc`.

### [Fixed: `process.memoryUsage().arrayBuffers`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#fixed-process-memoryusage-arraybuffers)

Previously, `process.memoryUsage().arrayBuffers` was always reporting `0`. Now we do our best to report the correct number.

What's interesting about this is a difference in how JavaScriptCore and V8 handle `ArrayBuffer` memory. In JavaScriptCore, typed array's buffers are "owned" by the TypedArray type (a `Uint8Array` and not an `ArrayBuffer`, for example). They don't become "shared" between `Uint8Array` and `ArrayBuffer` (or other typed arrays) until either:

* The `.buffer` property was accessed (creating the `ArrayBuffer`).
* The `.subarray` method was called (creating a shared reference).
* The typed array size is > 512 bytes.
* The typed array was externally allocated outside of JavaScript (such as when reading a file in Bun)

When the ArrayBuffer's contents are not owned by JavaScriptCore, they aren't included in the `process.memoryUsage().arrayBuffers` statistic, and instead are accounted for in the `process.memoryUsage().external` statistic.

#### Improved: module.findSourceMap

`require("module").findSourceMap` no longer throws an error when called. Previously, this threw an error saying we don't implement `module.SourceMap` yet. It's still not implemented, but throwing an error caused issues with Next.js in certain cases - so now we return `undefined` instead, which matches Node.js' behavior when no source map is found.

## [bun build](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#bun-build)

### [Improved stack overflow detection](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#improved-stack-overflow-detection)

Bun's JavaScript parser now proactively checks if it's about to run out of stack space, and throws an artifical stack overflow error.

Fixed (now a recoverable error):

```
❯ bun lots-of-for-loop.js
286 | for (let i = 0; i < 1; i++) for (let i = 0; i < 1; i++) for (let i = 0; i < 1; i++) for (let i = 0; i < 1; i++)
                                                      ^
error: Maximum call stack size exceeded
    at lots-of-for-loop.js:286:49
```

Previously, bun would crash with a hard SIGILL, which is not recoverable.

```
bun: killed SIGILL (core dumped)
```

### [Fixed: large number of if statements led to stack overflow](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#fixed-large-number-of-if-statements-led-to-stack-overflow)

Two things caused stack overflows with large numbers of nested if statements:

1. The statement parsing step for `if` statements was always recursive, even if the `if` statement was not nested. This recursion used too much stack space. Now it's no longer recursive.
2. The statement visiting step in Bun's JavaScript parser was originally a ~1,300 line function. This used several kilobytes of stack space, which became a problem when recursing through heavily nested if/for loops. We split it into more functions and avoided recursion more frequently.

### [Fixed: `#bun` pragma](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#fixed-bun-pragma)

Ordinarily, bun transpiles every file at runtime. To avoid potentially transpiling the same file multiple times, bun looks for a `// @bun` pragma comment.

There was a bug where Bun's JavaScript lexer would sometimes interpret the string `#bun` present in comments as the `bun` pragma meant for disabling transpilation.

This has been fixed, thanks to [@DonIsaac](https://github.com/DonIsaac)!

### [Fixed: cross-compile for musl in `bun build --compile`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#fixed-cross-compile-for-musl-in-bun-build-compile)

The code that parses the `--target` flag in `bun build --compile` wasn't updated for when we added musl support in Bun v1.1.40. This has been fixed, thanks to [@thecrypticace](https://github.com/thecrypticace).

### [Fixed: sourcemap comments CSS files](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#fixed-sourcemap-comments-css-files)

The `//# sourceMappingURL` comment meant for JavaScript files was being printed in CSS files. This has been fixed.

### [Fixed: crash when parsing malformed TypeScript enums](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#fixed-crash-when-parsing-malformed-typescript-enums)

A crash that occurred when handling malformed enums in the transpiler has been fixed.

```
// Example of a malformed enum that will generate a parse error
enum Foo { [2]: 'hi' }
```

Thanks to [@paperclover](https://github.com/paperclover) for implementing this!

## [Runtime improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#runtime-improvements)

### [Override `"Content-Length"` and `Transfer-Encoding` in Bun.serve()](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#override-content-length-and-transfer-encoding-in-bun-serve)

Bun.serve now supports overriding the `"Content-Length"` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers.

This is particularly useful for `HEAD` requests, where you want to return a `Content-Length` but not actually send the body.

```
const app = Bun.serve({
  port: 3000,
  fetch(req) {
    return new Response("Hello World", {
      headers: { "Content-Length": "7" },
    });
  },
});
```

Thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari) for implementing this!

### [New: `stat` method in Bun.file(path)](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#new-stat-method-in-bun-file-path)

You can now use `stat` without `node:fs` in Bun.

```
import { file } from "bun";

await file("./path-to-file.txt").stat();
```

This returns useful information about the file, such as its size, type, and last modified date. This returns the same type as in `node:fs`'s `stat` function.

### [New: `delete` method in Bun.file(path)](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#new-delete-method-in-bun-file-path)

You can now delete files in Bun, without `node:fs`.

```
import { file } from "bun";

await file("./path-to-file.txt").delete();
```

### [More accurate heap snapshots](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#more-accurate-heap-snapshots)

The memory cost of adding entries to `performance.mark` and `performance.measure` is now reported accurately in heap snapshots.

### [Fixes to stack traces with eval and node:vm](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#fixes-to-stack-traces-with-eval-and-node-vm)

Ordinarily, Bun transpiles every file at runtime. This also means we have to sourcemap stack traces and error messages.

We don't transpile code for node:vm or for `eval` (it would break compatibility). However, in certain cases, when some of the stack frames in a stack trace were from `eval` or `node:vm` and some of them were from Bun, the trace could get incorrectly sourcemapped.

Also, the `//# sourceURL` comment was not always being respecteed in stack traces, which is particularly unhelpful for `eval` and `node:vm` where the sourceURL can be passed in (via comment for `eval`, and via options in `node:vm`).

This has been fixed.

### [Fixed: stack overflow in console.log](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#fixed-stack-overflow-in-console-log)

A stack overflow causing an unrecoverable crash that could occur in `console.log` has been fixed.

Now, `console.log` proactively checks for how much stack space remains, and throws a `StackOverflowError` if it's about to run out.

Along the way, we've also fixed several cases where Bun would use large amounts of stack space for file path buffers on Windows (Windows file paths go up to 64 KB)

### [Fixed: memory leak in `WebSocket` client](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#fixed-memory-leak-in-websocket-client)

A memory leak impacting the WebSocket client has been fixed.

### [`remove` and `isRemoved` in HTMLRewriter's `DocType`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#remove-and-isremoved-in-htmlrewriter-s-doctype)

Bun's `HTMLRewriter` implementation now includes `remove()` and `isRemoved()` methods. The `remove()` method allows users to delete the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration from the HTML document during transformation, and the `isRemoved()` property is a boolean that tells you if the `<!DOCTYPE>` has been removed.

```
const html = "<!DOCTYPE html><html><head></head><body>Hello</body></html>";

const rewriter = new HTMLRewriter().onDocument({
  doctype(doctype) {
    doctype.remove();
    console.log(doctype.removed); // Logs: true
  },
});

const result = rewriter.transform(html);
console.log(result); // Logs: "<html><head></head><body>Hello</body></html>"
```

Thanks to [@kimberly](https://github.com/kimberly) for implementing this!

### [Fixed: formatting `Set` in Bun.inspect](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#fixed-formatting-set-in-bun-inspect)

The formatting of `Set` objects in the `Bun.inspect()` function has been corrected. This ensures that when a `Set` is passed to `Bun.inspect()`, it will now display its contents properly formatted.

```
import { it, expect } from "bun:test";

it("Set is propperly formatted in Bun.inspect()", () => {
  const set = new Set(["foo", "bar"]);
  const formatted = Bun.inspect({ set });
  expect(formatted).toBe(`{
  set: Set(2) {
    "foo",
    "bar",
  },
}`);
});
```

Thanks to [@laesse](https://github.com/laesse) for implementing this!

### [Fixed: socket close behavior](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#fixed-socket-close-behavior)

In rare cases, the `close` callback for a socket could be called *after* the `end` callback. This has been fixed.

### [Fixed: Theroetical crash when iterating over properties](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#fixed-theroetical-crash-when-iterating-over-properties)

A bug in our JavaScriptCore <-> Zig bindings could lead to a crash when native code iterated through properties of an object in rare cases. This has been fixed.

### [Fixed: `export default <file-path>` in error messages](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#fixed-export-default-file-path-in-error-messages)

A bug that could cause bun to display "export default '<file-path>'" as the source code for an error message has been fixed.

## [Bun.sql is almost ready](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#bun-sql-is-almost-ready)

Over the last year, one of my side projects has been a fast, builtin PostgreSQL client for Bun, and it's almost ready.

```
import { sql } from "bun";
import { expect } from "bun:test";

const result = await sql`select 1 as x`;
expect(result).toEqual([{ x: 1 }]);
```

Bun.sql will be released in Bun v1.2 - coming in 13 days at the time of writing. You can try it in the canary build of Bun.

Here's what's new for `Bun.sql` in this release.

### [Fixed: duplicate column names & numeric column names](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#fixed-duplicate-column-names-numeric-column-names)

A crash that occurred when duplicate column names were returned in query results has been fixed.

```
const result = await sql`select 1 as x, 2 as x, 3 as x`;
expect(result).toEqual([{ x: 3 }]);

const result = await sql`select 1 as "1", 2 as "2", 3 as "3", 0 as "0"`;
expect(result).toEqual([{ "1": 1, "2": 2, "3": 3, "0": 0 }]);
```

Previously, we also wouldn't properly support numeric column names.

### [Fixed: JSONB support](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#fixed-jsonb-support)

Bun's builtin PostgreSQL client now supports the `jsonb` data type.

```
import { sql } from "bun";
import { expect } from "bun:test";

test("jsonb support", async () => {
  const result = await sql`select '{"foo": "bar"}'::jsonb as x`;
  expect(result).toEqual([{ x: { foo: "bar" } }]);
});
```

### [`onopen` and `onclose` callbacks](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.43#onopen-and-onclose-callbacks)

The `onopen` and `onclose` tell you when the database connection opened or closed.

```
import { SQL } from "bun";

const sql = new SQL({
  url: "postgres://localhost:5432/mydb",
  onopen: () => console.log("Connection opened"),
  onclose: () => console.log("Connection closed"),
});

const [{ x }] = await sql`select 1 as x`;
console.log({ x });
await sql.close();
console.log("closed");
```

This logs:

```
Connection opened
{ x: 1 }
Connection closed
closed
```
