### [Windows support improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.2#windows-support-improvements)

## [Fixed: `EBUSY` when saving bun.lockb](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.2#fixed-ebusy-when-saving-bun-lockb)

When adding dependencies to `bun.lockb`, sometimes `bun install` on Windows would throw an `EBUSY` error. This was caused by keeping file handles open for too long and not requesting the correct permissions.

Windows permissions continues to be complicated.

## [Fixed: `ENOENT` and `EEXIST` error when extracting tarballs to cache on Windows](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.2#fixed-enoent-and-eexist-error-when-extracting-tarballs-to-cache-on-windows)

Sometimes packages failed to install on Windows due to a race condition where extracting the tarball for an npm package would fail with `ENOENT` or `EEXIST` errors. This error was mostly caused by requesting the wrong permissions when opening the directory to the new tarball. We've made the code more error-tolerant and now it will request the correct permissions.

## [Fixed: `EBUSY` when using `next dev` or `vite dev` on Windows](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.2#fixed-ebusy-when-using-next-dev-or-vite-dev-on-windows)

A regression in v1.1.0 caused `next dev` and `vite dev` to throw an `EBUSY` error when running on Windows. The main cause was a permissions issue. We were keeping a file handle open for the watched directory when we didn't need to.

We've updated our integration tests to catch this bug in the future.

Along the way, we've rewritten how `fs.watch` works on Windows. `fs.watch` will auto-deduplicate fileystem paths so if multiple watchers watch the same path, it will only use the resources of one of them. This should make `fs.watch` faster, more reilable, and use less memory.

## [Fixed: `bun install` unable to install tarballs with invalid file paths](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.2#fixed-bun-install-unable-to-install-tarballs-with-invalid-file-paths)

Windows doesn't support charaacters like `?`, `<`, `>`, and more in file paths. Sometimes, npm packages have these characters in their file paths of the tarballs they publish. Bun was not handling that correctly. Now, `bun install` behaves the same as `npm install` on Windows and successfully installs the package but inserts a replacement character.

## [Fixed: `CouldntReadCurrentDirectory` error](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.2#fixed-couldntreadcurrentdirectory-error)

Bun was asking for too many permissions in directories, which could cause `CouldntReadCurrentDirectory` errors to throw for non-Administrator accounts on Windows.

## [Rewrote `fs.watch` on Windows](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.2#rewrote-fs-watch-on-windows)

We rewrote the implementation of `fs.watch` on Windows to be more reliable and faster.

It now de-duplicates file paths being watched internally, which reduces resource usage when using things like fs.watch in a glob.

### [Shell & bun run improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.2#shell-bun-run-improvements)

## [Support for `seq`, `yes`, `basename`, and `dirname` in Bun Shell](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.2#support-for-seq-yes-basename-and-dirname-in-bun-shell)

The GNU Coreutils commands `seq`, `yes`, `basename`, and `dirname` are now supported in Bun Shell, thanks to [@nektro](https://github.com/nektro).

foo/hello.js

```
import { $ } from "bun";

await $`seq 0 3`;
// 0
// 1
// 2
// 3

await $`basename $1`; // hello.js
await $`dirname $1`; // foo
```

## [Fixed: Parsing bugs with `*` in environment variables](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.2#fixed-parsing-bugs-with-in-environment-variables)

A few parsing bugs have been fixed with `*` in environment variables, thanks to [@zackradisic](https://github.com/zackradisic).

A bug that could cause `bun install` to hang for awhile has been fixed.

### [Bun install improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.2#bun-install-improvements)

## [install `--production` without a lockfile](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.2#install-production-without-a-lockfile)

You can now use `bun install --production` and `bun install --frozen-lockfile` without a lockfile. This is helpful for CI environments where you might not have checked in your `bun.lockb` to `git`. There was no real reason why this was banned previously, so we just removed the ban.

## [Fixed: Potential crash when downloading tarballs](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.2#fixed-potential-crash-when-downloading-tarballs)

A bug that could cause `bun install` to crash when downloading tarballs has been fixed. This sometimes caused an "Unreachable code reached" error in Bun for Windows.

### [WebKit upgrade](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.2#webkit-upgrade)

We've upgraded WebKit yet again! And the incredible @Constellation & JSC team brings us new performance improvements and bug fixes.

## [5x faster `{ ...obj }` clone](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.2#5x-faster-obj-clone)

In microbenchmarks, code like the following now runs 5x faster:

```
{ ...obj }
```

This optimization is specific to an empty object literal with a single `...` spread operator on another object.

bench

splat.mjs

bench

```
❯ bun splat.mjs
cpu: Apple M1 Max
runtime: bun 1.1.2 (arm64-darwin)

benchmark       time (avg)             (min … max)       p75       p99      p995
-------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------
{ ...obj }   20.33 ns/iter   (18.38 ns … 92.75 ns)  20.08 ns  49.05 ns  53.68 ns

❯ bun-1.1.0 splat.mjs

{ ...obj }  105.38 ns/iter (100.83 ns … 188.37 ns) 103.29 ns 146.97 ns 149.57 ns
```

splat.mjs

```
import { bench, run } from "mitata";

const obj = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
  c: 3,
  d: 4,
  e: 5,
  f: 6,
  g: 7,
  h: 8,
  i: 9,
};

bench("{ ...obj }", () => {
  return { ...obj };
});

await run();
```

### [Parser improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.2#parser-improvements)

## [Fixed: TypeScript parsing edgecase](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.2#fixed-typescript-parsing-edgecase)

A bug caused Bun's parser to fail to parse the following TypeScript code:

```
var bar: Bar extends string | infer Bar extends string ? Bar : never;
var bar: Bar extends string & infer Bar extends string ? Bar : never;
```

This bug has been fixed, thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway).
