## [New features](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.23#new-features)

### [`TextEncoderStream` & `TextDecoderStream`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.23#textencoderstream-textdecoderstream)

We've implemented the [`TextEncoderStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextEncoderStream) and [`TextDecoderStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextDecoderStream) Web APIs. These APIs are the streaming equivalents of [`TextEncoder`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextEncoder) and [`TextDecoder`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextDecoder).

You can use `TextDecoderStream` to decode a stream of bytes into a stream of UTF-8 strings.

```
const response = await fetch("https://example.com");
const body = response.body.pipeThrough(new TextDecoderStream());

for await (const chunk of body) {
  console.log(chunk); // typeof chunk === "string"
}
```

You can use `TextEncoderStream` to encode a stream of UTF-8 strings into a stream of bytes.

```
const stream = new ReadableStream({
  start(controller) {
    controller.enqueue("Hello, world!");
    controller.close();
  },
});
const body = stream.pipeThrough(new TextEncoderStream());

for await (const chunk of body) {
  console.log(chunk); // chunk instanceof Uint8Array
}
```

`TextEncoderStream` in Bun is relatively fast.

#### Why TextEncoderStream?

The `TextEncoderStream` API is used in popular packages like Next.js' App Router for middleware.

Since most natively-implemented streams in Bun support both text and binary data, you rarely ever need to use `TextEncoderStream` in Bun. In fact, using `TextEncoderStream` in Bun is slower than not using it because it adds significant overhead to the stream. So, don't use this API unless a library you depend on is already using it.

#### `stream` option in `TextDecoder`

This release also adds support for the `stream` option in `TextDecoder`. This tells the decoder that chunks are part of a larger stream, and it should not throw an error if chunk is not a complete UTF-8 code point.

```
const decoder = new TextDecoder("utf-8");
const first = decoder.decode(new Uint8Array([226, 153]), { stream: true });
const second = decoder.decode(new Uint8Array([165]), { stream: true });

console.log(first); // ""
console.log(second); // "♥"
```

### [50% faster `console.log(string)`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.23#50-faster-console-log-string)

In this release of bun, we made `console.log(string)` 50% faster.

> In the next version of Bun  
>   
> console.log(string) gets 50% faster, thanks to [@justjs14](https://twitter.com/justjs14?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) [pic.twitter.com/DBKd1fKODe](https://t.co/DBKd1fKODe)

Previously, Bun had a fast-path for printing a single string with `console.log()`. In theory, this would mean that only 1 syscall would be needed to print the string. However, this was not the case because `console.log()` needs to print a newline character and reset ANSI escape codes. We made it faster by removing this no-so-fast-path and buffering the write like in other cases.

Thanks to [@billywhizz](https://github.com/billywhizz) and [@nektro](https://github.com/nektro) for making this faster!

### [Truncate large arrays in `console.log()`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.23#truncate-large-arrays-in-console-log)

When you `console.log(largeArray)` a large array in Bun, instead of printing out the entire array element by element, Bun will now stop after printing 100 total elements, and print an ellipsis with a count (`... 1,234 more items`) to indicate that there are more elements.

Thanks to [@nektro](https://github.com/nektro) for working on this feature!

### [`Float16Array`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.23#float16array)

In this release of Bun, there is support for the newly added [`Float16Array`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Float16Array) API. This is a [stage 3](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-float16array) TC39 proposal that was implemented in WebKit.

```
const float16 = new Float16Array(3);
const float32 = new Float32Array(3);

for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  float16[i] = i + 0.123;
  float32[i] = i + 0.123;
}

console.log(float16); // Float16Array(3) [ 0, 1.123046875, 2.123046875 ]
console.log(float32); // Float32Array(3) [ 0, 1.1230000257492065, 2.122999906539917 ]
```

Thanks to the WebKit team for implementing this feature!

### [Better handling of out-of-memory errors](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.23#better-handling-of-out-of-memory-errors)

We improved how out-of-memory errors are handled in `Response`, `Request,` `Blob`, and `node:fs`. Previously, Bun would crash or potentially truncate if an operation exceeded an engine limit, now Bun will check if the operation will definitely exceed a limit and properly throw an error if it does.

```
import { expect } from "bun:test";
const buf = Buffer.alloc(4294967295, "abc");
try {
  const blob = new Blob([buf, buf]);
  await blob.text();
} catch (e) {
  expect(e.message).toBe(
    "Cannot create a string longer than 2^32-1 characters",
  );
  expect(e.code).toBe("ERR_STRING_TOO_LONG");
}

// Before: `catch` block would not be called
// After: `catch` block is called
```

The improved out-of-memory error handling affects the following APIs:

* `text()`, `json()`, `bytes()`, `formData()`,`arrayBuffer()` methods on `Blob`, `Request`, and `Response`
* `fs.writeFile()` & `fs.readFile()`

## [Node.js compatibility improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.23#node-js-compatibility-improvements)

### [Fixed: `fs.F_OK`, `fs.R_OK`, `fs.W_OK`, and similar constants](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.23#fixed-fs-f-ok-fs-r-ok-fs-w-ok-and-similar-constants)

We fixed a bug where `node:fs` constants, such as `F_OK`, were not defined in Bun. These were deprecated in favor of `fs.constants` in Node.js 20, but are still defined for compatibility reasons.

```
import fs from "node:fs";

console.log(fs.F_OK); // old way
console.log(fs.constants.F_OK); // new way
```

### [Fixed: `fs.readFile` memory & size limits](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.23#fixed-fs-readfile-memory-size-limits)

Strings and typed arrays in Bun are limited to 2^32 characters of length by the engine (JavaScriptCore). Node.js/V8 has a lower limit for strings and a higher limit for typed arrays.

When reading files larger than this limit with `fs.readFile`, previously Bun would behave incorrectly. In certain cases, Bun would crash due to incorrect JavaScript exception handling and in other cases, Bun would potentially return a truncated string or typed array.

Now, Bun will throw an error if the file as soon as it is known that the file will not be able to be read from JavaScript. This saves you memory and CPU time because it avoids reading the complete file into memory before throwing an error.

## [Fixed: Backpressure in 'ws' module](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.23#fixed-backpressure-in-ws-module)

We fixed a bug where calling `WebSocket.send()` under high-load would cause a message to be sent multiple times. This was due to incorrect handling of backpressure when a message was rejected by the socket.

```
import { WebSocket } from "ws";

const ws = new WebSocket("ws://example.com");

ws.on("open", () => {
  for (let i = 0; i < 1_000; i++) {
    ws.send(`Hello, world! ${i}`);
  }
});

// Before:            | After:
// ...                | ...
// Hello, world! 999  | Hello, world! 997
// Hello, world! 999  | Hello, world! 998
// Hello, world! 999  | Hello, world! 999
// ...                | ...
```

This only affected `WebSocket` clients that were created by importing the `ws` package, which Bun changes to use our own implementation of `WebSocket`.

Thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari) for fixing this bug!

### [Cross-runtime IPC on Windows with Node.js](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.23#cross-runtime-ipc-on-windows-with-node-js)

We fixed a bug where inter-process-communication (IPC) in `node:child_process` would not work on Windows when sending messages between Bun and Node.js processes. In certain cases, this could cause some build tools to hang on Windows.

Thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari) for fixing this bug!

### [JIT crashes in `node:vm`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.23#jit-crashes-in-node-vm)

We fixed several crashes that could occur when code is JIT'd and being evaluated in a `node:vm` context. This would occur when the `globalThis` object in the `node:vm` context was not the same as the real `globalThis` object.

```
import { Script } from "node:vm";

const script = new Script(`
  for (let i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++) {
    performance.now();
  }
`);

script.runInContext(globalThis); // ok
script.runInContext({ performance }); // would crash
```

This affected only certain code paths after about a million times invocations:

* `performance.now()`
* `TextEncoder.encode()` & `TextDecoder.decode()`
* `crypto.randomUUID()` & `crypto.getRandomValues()`
* `crypto.timingSafeEqual()`

Thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) for fixing this bug!

## [Bugfixes](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.23#bugfixes)

### [Fixed: Buffering gigabytes of data over `Bun.serve()`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.23#fixed-buffering-gigabytes-of-data-over-bun-serve)

We fixed a bug where receving then streaming a large response from `Bun.serve()` would cause the response to be truncated. This was because if the data was larger than `2^32-1` bytes, the flush would be truncated.

Thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari) for fixing this bug!

### [Fixed: moving tagged template literals when bundling](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.23#fixed-moving-tagged-template-literals-when-bundling)

We fixed a bundler bug where tagged template literals would be incorrectly moved during bundling. This would cause the template literal to be evaluated in the wrong scope, which would cause it to throw an error.

foo.ts

```
globalThis.foo = () => console.log("foo");
const bar = await import("./bar.ts");
```

bar.ts

```
console.log("bar");
export const bar = foo`bar`;
```

```
// Before: TypeError: undefined is not a function (near '...foo`)
// After: bar\nfoo
```

This was a regression introduced in Bun v1.1.18, and has now been fixed.

Thanks to [@paperclover](https://github.com/paperclover) for fixing this bug!

### [Fixed: AbortSignal with `fetch()` when using custom TLS certificates](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.23#fixed-abortsignal-with-fetch-when-using-custom-tls-certificates)

We fixed a bug where calling `fetch()` with a custom TLS certificate would not abort the request due to a timeout. Bun supports [`tls`](https://bun.sh/docs/api/fetch#tls) options when making a `fetch()` request, which if often needed in non-browser environments where you need to use a custom TLS certificate.

```
const response = await fetch("https://example.com", {
  signal: AbortSignal.timeout(1000),
  tls: {
    ca: "...",
  },
});
```

Thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari) for fixing this bug!

### [Fixed: memory leak when `new Response` threw an error](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.23#fixed-memory-leak-when-new-response-threw-an-error)

We fixed a memory leak where setting a custom `statusText` on a `new Response` would not be cleaned up. We've also added more tests to ensure that leaks to `Request` and `Response` are caught.

### [Fixed: crash when importing an empty `.toml` file](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.23#fixed-crash-when-importing-an-empty-toml-file)

We fixed a bug when importing an empty `.toml` file would cause Bun to crash. This would also affect certain `.json` files, like `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`.

```
import config from "./config.toml";

console.log(config);
// Before: <crash>
// After: { enabled: true }
```

### [Fixed: Regression with TLS sockets in 1.1.22](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.23#fixed-regression-with-tls-sockets-in-1-1-22)

A regression introduced in 1.1.22 could cause a crash when a TLS socket failed to connect due to a DNS issue has been fixed, thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari).
