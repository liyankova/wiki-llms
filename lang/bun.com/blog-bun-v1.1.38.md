### [Fixed: Debugger causing Bun to hang in VSCode terminal](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.38#fixed-debugger-causing-bun-to-hang-in-vscode-terminal)

A regression introduced in Bun v1.1.37 caused older versions of Bun to hang when run from the VSCode terminal in certain cases. This has been fixed.

### [Fixed: Crash impacting `postgres` npm package](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.38#fixed-crash-impacting-postgres-npm-package)

When using the `postgres` npm package, a crash could occur after upgrading from a TCP to a TLS socket when an application error occurred.

This has been fixed, thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari).

### [Fixed: `allowHalfOpen` & `exclusive` being set to `true` incorrectly](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.38#fixed-allowhalfopen-exclusive-being-set-to-true-incorrectly)

An arguments validation regression introduced in Bun v1.1.34 caused `allowHalfOpen` to be set to `true` when `false` was passed. This has been fixed, thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari).

This impacted `node:net` and `Bun.listen`.

### [console.log improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.38#console-log-improvements)

> In the next version of Bun  
>   
> console.log includes extended classes, null prototype, and prints arguments like an array, thanks to RiskyMH [pic.twitter.com/DIsYRb8mdj](https://t.co/DIsYRb8mdj)

### [`reusePort` option in Bun.listen](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.38#reuseport-option-in-bun-listen)

The `reusePort` option has been added to `Bun.listen` and `node:net`. This is consistent with the behavior in `Bun.serve`.

### [Fixed: Bun.FileSystemRouter.reload() missing new directory contents](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.38#fixed-bun-filesystemrouter-reload-missing-new-directory-contents)

A cache invalidation issue caused `reload()` in `Bun.FileSystemRouter` to miss new directory contents. This has been fixed, thanks to [@Kapsonfire-DE](https://github.com/Kapsonfire-DE).

### [Fixed: Module resolution cache invalidation bug on Windows](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.38#fixed-module-resolution-cache-invalidation-bug-on-windows)

A module resolution cache invalidation bug was causing incorrect behavior on Windows. This has been fixed, thanks to [@Kapsonfire-DE](https://github.com/Kapsonfire-DE).

### [Fixed: File descriptor limit exceeded on musl](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.38#fixed-file-descriptor-limit-exceeded-on-musl)

When Bun used the `prlimit` libc function on musl to ask how many file descriptors Bun can open, musl often lied and said Bun could only open 1024 file descriptors or so.

Now, we don't trust the result of `prlimit` function to tell us when the number is relatively low, and attempt to ask for a number greater than the reported limit.

### [Updated SQLite from 3.45 -> 3.47](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.38#updated-sqlite-from-3-45-3-47)

The version of SQLite `bun:sqlite` embeds on Linux and Windows has been updated from 3.45 to 3.47.

Release notes from the SQLite team can be found [here](https://www.sqlite.org/changes.html):

* [SQLite3 v3.46.0](https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_46_0.html)
* [SQLite3 v3.47.0](https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_47_0.html)

In Bun's repo, we've also setup auto-updating of native dependencies like sqlite, libarchive, etc to minimize delays for future updates.

### [Fixed: Rare crash in fetch()](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.38#fixed-rare-crash-in-fetch)

A difficult to trigger crash in `fetch()` has been fixed, thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari)

### [Fixed: Re-assigning global modules in `--print` or `--eval`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.38#fixed-re-assigning-global-modules-in-print-or-eval)

When using `--print` or `--eval`, an assertion failure could occur when re-assigning global modules.

For example, the following code would trigger an assertion failure:

```
// like in node, --print and --eval make a number of modules available globally.
const fs = require("node:fs");
```

### [Fixed: TypeScript minification bug](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.38#fixed-typescript-minification-bug)

The following code was minified incorrectly:

```
export class Foo {
  constructor(public name: string) {}
}
```

Before:

```
class o{c;constructor(c){this.name=c}}export{o as Foo};
```

After:

```
class o{name;constructor(c){this.name=c}}export{o as Foo};
```

We were incorrectly minifying the property name on the class instance, causing issues with `Object.keys` and other similar functions.

This has been fixed, thanks to [@heimskr](https://github.com/heimskr).
