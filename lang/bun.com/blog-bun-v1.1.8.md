[Ashcon Partovi](https://twitter.com/ashconpartovi) · May 10, 2024

Bun v1.1.8 is here! This release fixes 54 bugs (addressing 184 👍). Support for `process.on("uncaughtException")` and `process.on("unhandledRejection")`, `JSON.parse` gets faster, Brotli support in `node:zlib`, `[Symbol.dispose]` in Bun APIs, fixes lots of crashes on Windows, and many other bugfixes.

We're hiring [systems engineers](https://bun.com/careers) in San Francisco to build the future of JavaScript!

#### Previous releases

* [`v1.1.7`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.7) fixes 28 bugs (addressing 11 👍). Glob workspace names in bun install. Asymmetric matcher support in expect.extends() equals. bunx --version. Bugfixes to JSX transpilation, sourcemaps, cross-compilation of standalone executables, bun shell, RegExp, Worker on Windows, and Node.js compatibility improvements.
* [`v1.1.6`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.6) fixes 10 bugs (addressing 512 👍 reactions). We've implemented UDP socket support & `node:dgram`. DataDog and ClickHouseDB now work. We've fixed a regression in `node:http` from v1.1.5. There are also Node.js compatibility improvements and bugfixes.
* [`v1.1.0`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1) Bundows. Windows support is here!

### [New: Support for `process.on("uncaughtException")` and `process.on("unhandledRejection")`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.8#new-support-for-process-on-uncaughtexception-and-process-on-unhandledrejection)

Bun now supports the `process.on("uncaughtException")` and `process.on("unhandledRejection")` events, which allow you to handle uncaught exceptions and unhandled promises in a more graceful way.

```
process.on("uncaughtException", (error) => {
  console.error("Uncaught exception:", error);
});

process.nextTick(() => {
  throw new Error("Oops!");
});
```

This also works for unhandled promises, which is useful for handling errors in asynchronous code.

```
process.on("unhandledRejection", (reason, promise) => {
  console.error("Unhandled rejection:", reason);
});

await 42;
throw new Error("Oops!");
```

This should resolve issues with various npm packages, like `puppeteer`, that would clean up resources if an unhandled exception occurred.

Thanks to [@gvilums](https://github.com/gvilums) for adding this feature!

### [New: Brotli support for `node:zlib`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.8#new-brotli-support-for-node-zlib)

Bun now implements the Brotli APIs in the `node:zlib` module, including `BrotliCompress()`, `BrotliDecompress()`, `brotliCompress()`, `brotliDecompress()`, and more!

```
import { brotliCompressSync, brotliDecompressSync } from "node:zlib";

const compressed = brotliCompressSync("Hello, world!");
console.log(compressed.toString("hex"));
// => 0b068048656c6c6f2c20776f726c642103

const decompressed = brotliDecompressSync(compressed);
console.log(decompressed.toString("utf8"));
// => Hello, world!
```

You can also use Brotli streams with the `zlib` module.

```
import { createBrotliCompress } from "node:zlib";

const compressor = createBrotliCompress();
compressor.write("Hello, world!");
compressor.end();

const compressed = compressor.read();
console.log(compressed.toString("hex"));
// => 0b068048656c6c6f2c20776f726c642103
```

#### Fixes a regression with `axios`

Adding support for Brotli also fixed a regression with `axios`, so it should now work again in Bun.

Thanks to [@nektro](https://github.com/nektro) for adding this feature!

### [New: Support for `[Symbol.dispose]` in Bun APIs](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.8#new-support-for-symbol-dispose-in-bun-apis)

Bun now supports the `[Symbol.dispose]` property on various APIs, including `Bun.spawn`, `Bun.serve`, `Bun.connect`, and `Bun.listen`. This allows you to define a variable with the `using` syntax, which is defined by the TC39 proposal for [Explicit resource management](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-explicit-resource-management) in JavaScript.

```
import { serve } from "bun";

{
  using server = serve({
    port: 0,
    fetch(request) {
      return new Response("Hello, world!");
    },
  });

  doStuff(server);
}

function doStuff(server) {
  // ...
}
```

In this example, the server is automatically closed when the `server` variable goes out of scope, even if an exception is thrown. This is useful for ensuring that resources are properly cleaned up, especially in tests.

```
import { spawn } from "bun";
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("able to spawn a process", async () => {
  using subprocess = spawn({
    cmd: [process.execPath, "-e", "console.log('Hello, world!')"],
    stdout: "pipe",
  });

  const stdout = new Response(subprocess.stdout).text();
  expect(stdout).resolves.toBe("Hello, world!");
});
```

Thanks to [@paperclover](https://github.com/paperclover) for implementing this feature!

### [Fixed: `Illegal instruction` on Windows](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.8#fixed-illegal-instruction-on-windows)

We fixed a bug in the build script of Bun that caused Windows dependencies to be built with the wrong CPU flags. This caused `Illegal instruction` errors with older CPUs on Windows.

> 6 line PR by [@paperclover\_dev](https://twitter.com/paperclover_dev?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) fixes a crash Windows users reported 80 times [pic.twitter.com/DmuHAgyd2j](https://t.co/DmuHAgyd2j)

This bug resolved over 18 GitHub issues and was caught thanks to Bun's new [crash reporter](https://bun.com/blog/bun-report-is-buns-new-crash-reporter).

### [Fixed: Crash with `console.log` using a `%i` format string](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.8#fixed-crash-with-console-log-using-a-i-format-string)

We fixed a bug where `console.log` could crash using a `%i` format string that was out of bounds for the number of arguments.

```
console.log("Hello %i %i", [1, 2, 3, 4]);
// Before: <panic>
// Now: 'Hello NaN %i'
```

Thanks to [@paperclover](https://github.com/paperclover) for fixing this bug!

### [Fixed: Several `workspace dependency not found` errors](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.8#fixed-several-workspace-dependency-not-found-errors)

We fixed various issues that would cause `bun install` to fail with `workspace dependency not found` errors.

* The first bug was caused by adding a new workspace dependency to a workspace that did not define a `version` property in its `package.json`.
* The second bug was caused by manually adding a workspace dependency to the `packages` property in the workspace `package.json`, then attempting to run `bun install`.

We are still working on making workspaces better in Bun. If you still experience problems with workspaces, please [file an issue](https://bun.com/issues).

### [Fixed: Crash with `console.table` when being called repeatedly](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.8#fixed-crash-with-console-table-when-being-called-repeatedly)

We fixed a bug were the reference counting of strings using `console.table` was being incorrectly calculated, which could cause a crash.

```
for (let i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
  console.table([{ n: 8 }]);
}
```

Thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) for fixing this bug!

### [Fixed: Bug with `createReadStream` with a file descriptor and offset](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.8#fixed-bug-with-createreadstream-with-a-file-descriptor-and-offset)

We fixed a bug where using `createReadStream` with a file descriptor and start offset would cause the offset to be ignored.

```
import { openSync, createReadStream, writeSync } from "node:fs";

const fd = openSync("hello.txt", "w+");
const stream = createReadStream("", { fd: fd, start: 2 });

stream.on("data", (chunk) => {
  // Before: "Hello, world!"
  // Now: "llo, world!"
});

writeSync(fd, "Hello, world!");
```

Thanks to [@gvilums](https://github.com/gvilums) for fixing this bug!

### [Fixed: `confirm()` did not work on Windows](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.8#fixed-confirm-did-not-work-on-windows)

Bun implements the [`confirm()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/confirm) Web API, which prompts the terminal for a confirmation message. We were not properly handling Windows line endings, so the confirmation would never be`true`.

```
if (confirm("Are you sure?")) {
  console.log("Yes!");
} else {
  console.log("No!");
}
```

This was fixed thanks to [@rcaselles](https://github.com/rcaselles).

### [Fixed: Bug with `os.cpus()` for some CPUs](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.8#fixed-bug-with-os-cpus-for-some-cpus)

We fixed a bug where `os.cpus()` would throw an error when the CPU string was too long.

```
import { cpus } from "node:os";

console.log(cpus());
// Before: <error: Failed to get cpu information>
// Now: [ { model: "Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10875H CPU @ 2.30GHz", ... } ]
```

This was fixed thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway).

### [Fixed: Missing `agent` property on `ClientRequest`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.8#fixed-missing-agent-property-on-clientrequest)

We fixed a bug where the `agent` property was missing on the `ClientRequest` class.

```
import { request } from "node:http";

const req = request("https://example.com");
console.log(req.agent);
// Before: undefined
// Now: <Agent>
```

Thanks to [@nektro](https://github.com/nektro) for fixing this bug!

### [Fixed: Redirecting stdout from `Bun.spawn()` to `Bun.serve()` was not working](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.8#fixed-redirecting-stdout-from-bun-spawn-to-bun-serve-was-not-working)

There was a bug where redirecting stdout from `Bun.spawn()` to `Bun.serve()` was not working. This has now been fixed.

```
import { spawn, serve } from "bun";

const server = serve({
  port: 0,
  async fetch(req) {
    const { stdout } = spawn({
      cmd: [process.execPath, "-e", 'console.write("Hello, world!")'],
      stdout: "pipe",
    });

    return new Response(stdout);
  },
});

const response = await fetch(server.url);
console.write(await response.text());
server.stop(true);
```

### [Fixed: `onread` not working in `node:net`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.8#fixed-onread-not-working-in-node-net)

We added support for the `onread` event in the `node:net` module, which allows you to listen for incoming data on a socket.

```
import { connect } from "node:net";

const socket = connect({
  host: "example.com",
  port: 80,
  onread: {
    buffer: Buffer.alloc(1024),
    callback(size, buffer) {
      console.log("onread:", size);
    },
  },
});

socket.write("GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n");
// Before: <nothing>
// Now: onread: 504
```

Thanks to [@gvilums](https://github.com/gvilums) for fixing this bug!

### [Fixed: Crash in InlineCacheCompiler](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.8#fixed-crash-in-inlinecachecompiler)

A crash that could occur when a function was accessed in certain ways and subsequently garbage collected after some minutes of activity has been fixed. This crash was an upstream issue in the JavaScriptCore engine that began in Bun v1.1.7 and has now been resolved. Some users reported this crash occurring while using Next.js.

### [Fixed: Better stub for `node:inspector`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.8#fixed-better-stub-for-node-inspector)

Bun does not support the `node:inspector` module, since it depends on the [Chrome DevTools protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/), which is similar but not the same as WebKit's protocol.

Previously, Bun would throw an unimplemented error when trying to use `inspector.url()`. Now, we have changed it to return `undefined`, which is the allowed behavior according to the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/inspector.html#inspector_inspector_url).

Some npm packages, like `typedoc`, use this API for feature detection. With these changes, those packages will now work with Bun.

```
import { url } from "node:inspector";
// ...
const isDebugging = () => !!url();
```

Thanks to [@Electroid](https://github.com/Electroid) for making this better!
