# Bun v0.5.7

[Ashcon Partovi](https://twitter.com/ashconpartovi) · February 24, 2023

Bun v0.5.7 introduces `FormData` support, `git` dependencies, and `AbortSignal` with `fetch()`, `setTimeout()` is now more compatible with Node.js, `bun wiptest` is now `bun test` — with pretty-printed diffs! — and improved support on AWS Lambda and GitHub Actions.

```
# Install using curl
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Install using npm
# npm install -g bun

# Upgrade
bun upgrade
```

## [`FormData` support](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.7#formdata-support)

Bun now supports [`FormData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData), a standard Web API for working with form fields and files in multipart uploads. You can add a `string` as a field or a `Blob` as a file.

```
const formData = new FormData();
formData.set("attachment-id", crypto.randomUUID());
formData.set("attachment", Bun.file("./package.json"));
const response = await fetch("https://example.com/upload", {
  method: "POST",
  body: formData,
});
```

You can also parse `FormData` from a `Request` or `Response`.

```
export default {
  async fetch(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
    const formData = await request.formData();
    const file = formData.get("attachment");
    // ...
    return new Response(file);
  },
};
```

In Bun, [`response.formData()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/formData) runs:

* **25x** faster than Node v19.6.0
* **4x** faster than Deno v1.30.3

## [Git dependencies](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.7#git-dependencies)

Bun now supports `git` dependencies in `package.json`. Bun accepts a variety of git dependency formats, including [`github`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#github-urls), [`git`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#git-urls-as-dependencies), `git+ssh`, `git+https`, and many more.

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "zod": "github:colinhacks/zod",
    "lodash": "git@github.com:lodash/lodash.git#4.17.21"
  }
}
```

You can also add a `git` dependency using `bun install`.

```
bun install git@github.com:moment/moment.git
```

## [Changes to `setTimeout()`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.7#changes-to-settimeout)

The Web standard [`setTimeout()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout) returns a `number`, which represents a timeout ID. The Node.js implementation of [`setTimeout()`](https://nodejs.org/api/timers.html#cleartimeouttimeout) returns a `Timeout` object, which has methods like `ref()` and `unref()`, but is coercable to a `number`.

We (reluctantly) decided to change Bun's implementation to match Node.js because there are many `npm` packages that depend on this legacy behaviour.

```
const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
  process.abort(); // this is not called, see `unref()` below
}, 1000);

timeout.unref();

// For compatibility, it still works as a number
const timeoutId = +timeout; // 1
```

We also improved the `console.log()` formatting of the `Timeout` object.

## [`AbortSignal` with `fetch()`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.7#abortsignal-with-fetch)

You can now cancel a [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) request using an [`AbortSignal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal). This is useful for timeouts or when you need to cancel a request before a response is received.

```
await fetch("https://example.com", {
  // Abort if the response is not received after 1 second
  signal: AbortSignal.timeout(1000),
});
```

You can also use an `AbortSignal` when receiving a `Request` from the HTTP server.

```
export default {
  async fetch(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
    request.signal.addEventListener("abort", () => {
      console.log("Client aborted the request");
    });
    // ...
    return new Response();
  },
};
```

## [`bun wiptest` is now `bun test`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.7#bun-wiptest-is-now-bun-test)

It's time for `bun wiptest` to graduate to `bun test`.

### [Pretty-printed diffs](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.7#pretty-printed-diffs)

`bun test` now supports pretty-printed diffs, thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) for implementing and @SuperAuguste for porting the [diff-match-patch](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch) algorithm to Zig.

**Now:**

```
error: expect(received).toEqual(expected)

  {
    abc: 123,
+   def: 456
-   def: 789
  }

- Expected  - 1
+ Received  + 1
```

**Before:**

```
error: Expected values to be equal:
	Expected: {
  abc: 123,
  def: 789
}
	Received: {
  abc: 123,
  def: 456
}
```

### [Auto-import for `jest` globals](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.7#auto-import-for-jest-globals)

`bun test` now automatically imports [`test()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/api#testname-fn-timeout) and [`expect()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect#expectvalue). This also works for the other Jest globals, including: `describe`, `beforeAll`, `afterAll`, and more.

```
// import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("that it auto-imports expect()", () => {
  expect({
    abc: 123,
    def: 456,
  }).toEqual({
    abc: 123,
    def: 789,
  });
});
```

We still recommended that you import from `bun:test`, but if you have existing tests using Jest, you probably rely on its globals.

## [New methods on `Set`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.7#new-methods-on-set)

The [`Set`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) class now has [more built-in](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-set-methods) methods, thanks to [@kmiller68](https://github.com/kmiller68) at WebKit.

```
const a = new Set([1, 2, 3]);
const b = new Set([1, 3, 4, 5]);
const c = new Set([1, 3]);

console.log(a.union(b)); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(a.intersection(b)); // [1, 3]
console.log(a.difference(b)); // [2]
console.log(a.symmetricDifference(b)); // [2, 4, 5]
```

## [AWS Lambda support](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.7#aws-lambda-support)

Bun can now run AWS Lambda using a [custom layer.](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/tree/main/packages/bun-lambda#bun-lambda)

The layer will detect when an event is an HTTP request and transform it into a standard [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request). This means you can test your Lambda locally using `bun run`, without any code changes.

```
export default {
  async fetch(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
    console.log(request.headers.get("x-amzn-function-arn"));
    // ...
    return new Response("Hello from Lambda!", {
      status: 200,
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "text/plain",
      },
    });
  },
};
```

For events that are not HTTP requests, like a S3 or SQS trigger, the event will be in the body of the `Request`.

```
export default {
  async fetch(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
    const event = await request.json();
    // ...
    return new Response();
  },
};
```

## [GitHub Action support](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.7#github-action-support)

There is a new release of the [`setup-bun`](https://github.com/oven-sh/setup-bun) GitHub Action, which you can also [find](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-bun) on the GitHub Marketplace. Thanks to [@xHyroM](https://github.com/xHyroM) for maintaining the initial version of it.

```
- uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
  with:
    bun-version: latest
```

```
- uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
  with:
    bun-version: "0.5.7"
```

Now, with the newly added support for `git` dependencies, we encourage you to try this out in your GitHub CI and see much time you can save with `bun install`.

```
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
  - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
    with:
      node-version: 16
+ - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v1
+   with:
+     bun-version: latest
+  - run: bun install
-  - run: npm install
```
