# Bun v0.8.0

---

[Colin McDonnell](https://twitter.com/colinhacks) · August 24, 2023

Bun v0.8.0 adds debugger support, implements fetch streaming, and unblocks [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). ReadStream and WriteStream from `node:tty` are implemented, and `.setRawMode()` now works on `process.stdin`, unblocking several interactive CLI tools. Plus Node.js compatibility updates, bug fixes, stability improvements.

Bun 1.0 is coming on September 7th! Register for the launch stream at <https://bun.sh/1.0>.

Bun is an incredibly fast JavaScript runtime, bundler, transpiler, and package manager — all in one. We've been releasing a lot of changes to Bun recently. Here's a recap of the last few releases. In case you missed it:

* [`v0.7.0`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.7.0) - Web Workers, `--smol`, `structuredClone()`, WebSocket reliability improvements, `node:tls` fixes, and more.
* [`v0.7.1`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.7.1) - ES Modules load 30-250% faster, `fs.watch` fixes, and lots of `node:fs` compatibility improvements.
* [`v0.7.2`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.7.1) - Implements `node:worker_threads`, `node:diagnostics_channel`, and [`BroadcastChannel`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel).
* [`v0.7.3`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.7.1) - Coverage reporting in `bun test`, plus test filtering with `bun test -t`.

To install Bun:

curl

npm

brew

docker

curl

```
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

npm

```
npm install -g bun
```

brew

```
brew tap oven-sh/bun
```

```
brew install bun
```

docker

```
docker pull oven/bun
```

```
docker run --rm --init --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 oven/bun
```

To upgrade Bun:

```
bun upgrade
```

## [Debugger support](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.0#debugger-support)

Bun now implements debugger support via WebKit's Inspector Protocol. To use it, run your file or script with the `--inspect` flag. Consider the following simple HTTP server.

server.ts

```
const server = Bun.serve({
  fetch(req){
    console.log(req.url);
    return new Response("Hello world!");
  }
});

console.log(`Listening on http://localhost:${server.port}`);
```

When we run this file with `--inspect`, it starts our HTTP server *and* spins up a localhost WebSocket server on an unused port. This WebSocket server uses the Inspector Protocol to communicate with debugging tools, which can introspect and control the running `bun` process.

```
bun --inspect server.ts
```

```
Listening on http://localhost:3000
------------------ Bun Inspector ------------------
Listening at:
  ws://localhost:6499/0tqxs9exrgrm

Inspect in browser:
  https://debug.bun.sh/#localhost:6499/0tqxs9exrgrm
------------------ Bun Inspector ------------------
```

### [Using `debug.bun.sh`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.0#using-debug-bun-sh)

The `--inspect` flag will also print a `https://debug.bun.sh#` URL to the console. This domain `debug.bun.sh` hosts a stripped-down version of Safari Developer Tools designed for debugging Bun. Open the link in your preferred browser and a new debugging session will start automatically.

[![](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/assets/3084745/3b69c7e9-25ff-4f9d-acc4-caa736862935)](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/assets/3084745/3b69c7e9-25ff-4f9d-acc4-caa736862935)

Bun Developer Tools at debug.bun.sh

From the web debugger, you can inspect the currently running code and set breakpoints. Once a breakpoint is triggered, you can:

* View all variables in scope
* Execute code in the console, with full access to in-scope variables and Bun APIs
* Step through your code step-by-step

[![screenshot of Bun debugger](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/assets/3084745/8b565e58-5445-4061-9bc4-f41090dfe769)](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/assets/3084745/8b565e58-5445-4061-9bc4-f41090dfe769)

Read the [Debug Bun with the web debugger](https://bun.com/guides/runtime/web-debugger) guide for more complete documentation.

## [`bun update`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.0#bun-update)

The new `bun update` command will update all project dependencies to the latest versions that are compatible with the semver ranges in your `package.json`.

```
bun update
```

To update a particular dependency:

```
bun update zod
```

**Note** — Unlike `npm`, the `bun upgrade` command is reserved for upgrading Bun itself. It is *not* an alias for `bun update`.

Thanks to [@alexlamsl](https://github.com/alexlamsl) for implementing this feature.

## [SvelteKit support](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.0#sveltekit-support)

Improved support for [environment variables in `Worker`](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/4052) has unblocked SvelteKit. Scaffold your project with `create-svelte`.

```
bunx create-svelte my-app
```

```
create-svelte version 5.0.5

┌  Welcome to SvelteKit!
│
◇  Which Svelte app template?
│  SvelteKit demo app
│
◇  Add type checking with TypeScript?
│  Yes, using TypeScript syntax
│
◇  Select additional options (use arrow keys/space bar)
│  none
│
└  Your project is ready!

✔ Typescript
  Inside Svelte components, use <script lang="ts">

Install community-maintained integrations:
  https://github.com/svelte-add/svelte-add
```

To install dependencies and start the dev server:

```
cd my-app
```

```
bun install
```

```
bun run dev -- --open
```

Open [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) to see the demo SvelteKit app in action.

[![](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/assets/3084745/7c76eae8-78f9-44fa-9f15-1bd3ca1a47c0)](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/assets/3084745/7c76eae8-78f9-44fa-9f15-1bd3ca1a47c0)

## [Support for Nuxt (`nuxt dev`)](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.0#support-for-nuxt-nuxt-dev)

With improved `node:tty` and `node:fs` support, the Nuxt development server now works with the Bun runtime. To get started, use the `nuxi` command-line tool.

```
bunx --bun nuxi init my-app
```

```
cd my-app
```

```
bun install
```

Once dependencies are installed, start the development server with the `"dev"` package.json script.

```
bun --bun run dev
```

```
 $ nuxt dev
Nuxt 3.6.5 with Nitro 2.5.2
  > Local:    http://localhost:3000/
  > Network:  http://192.168.0.21:3000/
  > Network:  http://[fd8a:d31d:481c:4883:1c64:3d90:9f83:d8a2]:3000/

✔ Nuxt DevTools is enabled v0.8.0 (experimental)
ℹ Vite client warmed up in 547ms
✔ Nitro built in 244 ms
```

The `--bun` flag ensures the server is using the Bun runtime instead of Node.js. By default the `nuxt` CLI uses Node.js.

Then visit <http://localhost:3000> to see the default Nuxt welcome screen.

[![](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/assets/3084745/2c683ecc-3298-4bb0-b8c0-cf4cfaea1daa)](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/assets/3084745/2c683ecc-3298-4bb0-b8c0-cf4cfaea1daa)

Nuxt app running on Bun

**Note** — There are still some issues with Nuxt's `build` command. When doing a production build, use `bun run build` instead of `bun --bun run build`. This will use Node.js to run Nuxt's build pipeline. Track this issue [here](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/3771).

Refer to the [Building an app with Nuxt and Bun](https://bun.com/guides/ecosystem/nuxt) for a more complete walkthrough.

## [Fetch response body streaming](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.0#fetch-response-body-streaming)

Bun now implements `fetch()` response body streaming, thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari). This means that you can now stream data from a fetch response, instead of waiting for the entire response to be downloaded.

```
const res = await fetch("https://example.com/bigfile.txt");

// read the response chunk-by-chunk!
for await (const chunk of res.body) {
  console.log(chunk);
}
```

### [Use OpenAI in Bun](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.0#use-openai-in-bun)

Streaming is especially useful when working with APIs that take awhile to respond. Now you can stream responses from OpenAI's API in Bun.

```
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: "my api key",
});

const stream = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Say this is a test" }],
  stream: true,
});

for await (const part of stream) {
  process.stdout.write(part.choices[0]?.delta?.content || "");
}
```

## [Bun.serve() streaming improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.0#bun-serve-streaming-improvements)

Previously, the following would buffer the response body, meaning it would only send the response once the entire body had been generated.

```
import { serve, sleep } from "bun";
serve({
  fetch(req) {
    return new Response(
      new ReadableStream({
        async pull(controller) {
          for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
            controller.enqueue("Hello world!");
            await sleep(42);
          }

          controller.close();
        },
      }),
    );
  },
});

// Hello World!Hello World!Hello World!...[~840ms]
```

That's not what people want! Now, the response body is streamed, meaning it's sent to the client as it's generated.

```
import { serve, sleep } from "bun";
serve({
  fetch(req) {
    return new Response(
      new ReadableStream({
        async pull(controller) {
          for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
            controller.enqueue("Hello world!");
            await sleep(42);
          }

          controller.close();
        },
      }),
    );
  },
});

// Hello world! [42ms]
// Hello world! [42ms]
// Hello world! [42ms]
```

Previously, streaming was only supported when using ReadableStream with `type: "direct"`, a Bun-specific fast path for streaming.

```
import { serve, sleep } from "bun";
serve({
  port: 3000,
  fetch(req) {
    return new Response(
      new ReadableStream({
        // bun specific option
        type: "direct",

        async pull(controller) {
          for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
            controller.write("Hello world!");

            // in bun < 0.8.0, flush() was required
            controller.flush();

            // now bun will automatically flush pending writes once the microtask queue is drained
            await sleep(42);
          }

          controller.end();
        },
      }),
    );
  },
});

// Hello world! [42ms]
// Hello world! [42ms]
// Hello world! [42ms]
// Hello world! [42ms]
```

We still have optimization work ahead to make streaming using the default ReadableStream type fast. For now, we recommend using `type: "direct"` to get the fastest possible streaming.

## [Support for `node:tty` and `process.stdin.setRawMode()`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.0#support-for-node-tty-and-process-stdin-setrawmode)

[![](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/assets/709451/5cd88625-5784-479a-8c32-634bff898579)](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/assets/709451/5cd88625-5784-479a-8c32-634bff898579)

Inquirer npm package in Bun

The `ReadStream` and `WriteStream` classes from `node:tty` have been implemented, and `process.stdin` is now an instance of `ReadStream`. Accordingly, it's now possible to enable "raw mode" on `process.stdin`.

```
process.stdin.setRawMode(true);
```

### [Support for `inquirer` and other prompt libraries](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.0#support-for-inquirer-and-other-prompt-libraries)

This makes it possible to read keypresses without waiting for a newline character, which is important for interactive CLI tools. The popular libraries [`inquirer`](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js), [`enquirer`](https://github.com/enquirer/enquirer), and [`prompts`](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts) are now fully supported.

Run the following command to interactively scaffold a Remix app using Bun and the interactive `create-remix` command-line tool.

```
bunx --bun create-remix
```

Thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) for implementing this feature.

## [Improvements to `bun test`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.0#improvements-to-bun-test)

### [`test.each` and `describe.each`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.0#test-each-and-describe-each)

Thanks to [@jecquas](https://github.com/jecquas), Bun now supports `test.each` and `describe.each` from Jest. This makes it easy to run the same test with different inputs.

```
describe.each([
  [1, 1, 2],
  [1, 2, 3],
  [2, 1, 3],
])("add(%i, %i)", (a, b, expected) => {
  test(`returns ${expected}`, () => {
    expect(a + b).toBe(expected);
  });
});
```

### [`.toSatisfy()` and `.toIncludeRepeated()`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.0#tosatisfy-and-toincluderepeated)

Thanks to [@TiranexDev](https://github.com/TiranexDev), `bun test` now supports [additional matchers](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/3651). These matchers are part of `jest-extended` and are now natively supported by `bun test`.

Sample usage of [`.toSatisfy()`](https://vitest.dev/api/expect.html#tosatisfy):

```
const isOdd = (value: number) => value % 2 !== 0;
it("toSatisfy", () => {
  expect(1).toSatisfy(isOdd);
  expect(2).not.toSatisfy(isOdd);
});
```

Sample usage of [`.toIncludeRepeated()`](https://jest-extended.jestcommunity.dev/docs/matchers/string/#toincluderepeatedsubstring-times):

```
test("toIncludeRepeated", () => {
  // check if string contains substring exactly 2 times
  expect("hello hello").toIncludeRepeated("hello", 2);
  // works with .not
  expect("hello hello world").not.toIncludeRepeated("hello", 1);
});
```

## [40x faster `buffer.toString("hex")`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.0#40x-faster-buffer-tostring-hex)

The Node.js `Buffer.toString("hex")` function gets optimized with SIMD, leading to 40x faster performance.

> In the next version of Bun  
>   
> Buffer.toString("hex") gets 40x faster [pic.twitter.com/Hz7rXBAjJw](https://t.co/Hz7rXBAjJw)

## [`Bun.inspect.custom`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.0#bun-inspect-custom)

Objects can now be augmented with custom formatters using the `Bun.inspect.custom` symbol. For compatibility reasons, `util.inspect.custom` from Node.js's `node:util` works too.

```
class Password {
  value: string;
  constructor(value: string) {
    this.value = value;
  }
  [Bun.inspect.custom]() {
    return "Password <********>";
  }
}

const p = new Password("secret");
console.log(p);
// => "Password <********>"
```

## [Global `File` constructor](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.0#global-file-constructor)

The `File` constructor has been added as a new global. `File` instances can be constructed.

```
const file = new File(["hello world"], "hello.txt", {
  type: "text/plain",
  lastModified: Date.now() - 1000,
});

file.size; // 11
file.name; // "hello.txt"
file.type; // "text/plain"
file.lastModified; // 1693597759310573
```

## [Crash in Buffer-related functions fixed](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.0#crash-in-buffer-related-functions-fixed)

A JIT crash in `Buffer`-related functions has been fixed. This crash was caused by incorrect side effects when passed to DOMJIT which led to a crash during type validation when the functions were called. This impacted several libraries and the crash began after a JavaScriptCore upgrade in Bun v0.7.3.

This crash would cause `EXC_BREAKPOINT` to be thrown after enough calls to `Buffer.alloc`, `Buffer.allocUnsafe`, `Buffer.isBuffer` were called.

## [Bugfixes and stability improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.0#bugfixes-and-stability-improvements)

**Buffer.toString("hex") memory leak fix**

A memory leak has [been fixed](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/4235) in the implementation of `buffer.toString("hex")`.

**NAPI fixes and support for `resvg`, `sharp`**

A couple bugs in the [`NAPIClass` constructor](https://bun.com/blog/NapiClass) and [`napi_create_external_arraybuffer` / `napi_create_external_buffer`](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/4221) have been fixed. The resolves issues when using [`resvg-js`](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js) or [`sharp`](https://github.com/lovell/sharp).

**Better error when `this` is invalid**

When calling a method with an unexpected value for `this`, Bun [now reports](https://twitter.com/jarredsumner/status/1692693498841931804) an informative error.

```
const { json } = new Response(`"hello"`);
json();
// ^ TypeError: Expected `this` to be instanceof Response
```

**Handle cross-device file copies**

Bun [now detects](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/1675) when a file copying operation (e.g `fs.copyFile`) is attempting to copy files across devices or partitions and falls back to a manual file copy syscall.

**Fix `Bun.deepEqual` URL comparison**

[`#4105`](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/4105) fixes a bug where URLs we're not properly compared by their internal `href`.

**10% Regression in async-await performance on macOS has been fixed**

* The daylight savings time cache is no longer updated on each microtask call. This regression began in v0.7.x.

**Several fixes to streams**

[`#4251`](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/4251) includes a number of improvements and bugfixes in the implementation of `ReadableStream` have been fixed. This includes:

* Pending writes to HTTP response bodies are automatically flushed once the microtask queue has been drained, fixing #1886
* Improved error handling inside `pull`.
