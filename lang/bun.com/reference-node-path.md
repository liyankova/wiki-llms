# Node.js path module | API Reference | Bun

Node.js module

# [path](https://bun.com/reference/node/path)

The `'node:path'` module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths, including `join`, `resolve`, `basename`, and `dirname`.

It normalizes path separators, handles relative paths, and provides platform-specific adjustments for POSIX and Windows paths.

Works in Bun

Fully implemented. 100% of Node.js's test suite passes.

* const [default](https://bun.com/reference/node/path/default): [PlatformPath](https://bun.com/reference/node/path/default/PlatformPath)

  + ### interface [PlatformPath](https://bun.com/reference/node/path/default/PlatformPath)

    - readonly [delimiter](https://bun.com/reference/node/path/default/PlatformPath/delimiter): ';' | ':'

      The platform-specific file delimiter. ';' or ':'.
    - readonly [posix](https://bun.com/reference/node/path/default/PlatformPath/posix): [PlatformPath](https://bun.com/reference/node/path/default/PlatformPath)

      Posix specific pathing. Same as parent object on posix.
    - readonly [sep](https://bun.com/reference/node/path/default/PlatformPath/sep): '\' | '/'

      The platform-specific file separator. '\' or '/'.
    - readonly [win32](https://bun.com/reference/node/path/default/PlatformPath/win32): [PlatformPath](https://bun.com/reference/node/path/default/PlatformPath)

      Windows specific pathing. Same as parent object on windows
    - [basename](https://bun.com/reference/node/path/default/PlatformPath/basename)(

      path: string,

      suffix?: string

      ): string;

      Return the last portion of a path. Similar to the Unix basename command. Often used to extract the file name from a fully qualified path.

      @param path

      the path to evaluate.

      @param suffix

      optionally, an extension to remove from the result.
    - [dirname](https://bun.com/reference/node/path/default/PlatformPath/dirname)(

      path: string

      ): string;

      Return the directory name of a path. Similar to the Unix dirname command.

      @param path

      the path to evaluate.
    - [extname](https://bun.com/reference/node/path/default/PlatformPath/extname)(

      path: string

      ): string;

      Return the extension of the path, from the last '.' to end of string in the last portion of the path. If there is no '.' in the last portion of the path or the first character of it is '.', then it returns an empty string.

      @param path

      the path to evaluate.
    - [format](https://bun.com/reference/node/path/default/PlatformPath/format)(

      pathObject: [FormatInputPathObject](https://bun.com/reference/node/path/default/FormatInputPathObject)

      ): string;

      Returns a path string from an object - the opposite of parse().

      @param pathObject

      path to evaluate.
    - [isAbsolute](https://bun.com/reference/node/path/default/PlatformPath/isAbsolute)(

      path: string

      ): boolean;

      Determines whether {path} is an absolute path. An absolute path will always resolve to the same location, regardless of the working directory.

      If the given {path} is a zero-length string, `false` will be returned.

      @param path

      path to test.
    - [join](https://bun.com/reference/node/path/default/PlatformPath/join)(

      ...paths: string[]

      ): string;

      Join all arguments together and normalize the resulting path.

      @param paths

      paths to join.
    - [matchesGlob](https://bun.com/reference/node/path/default/PlatformPath/matchesGlob)(

      path: string,

      pattern: string

      ): boolean;

      The `path.matchesGlob()` method determines if `path` matches the `pattern`.

      @param path

      The path to glob-match against.

      @param pattern

      The glob to check the path against.

      @returns

      Whether or not the `path` matched the `pattern`.
    - [normalize](https://bun.com/reference/node/path/default/PlatformPath/normalize)(

      path: string

      ): string;

      Normalize a string path, reducing '..' and '.' parts. When multiple slashes are found, they're replaced by a single one; when the path contains a trailing slash, it is preserved. On Windows backslashes are used.

      @param path

      string path to normalize.
    - [parse](https://bun.com/reference/node/path/default/PlatformPath/parse)(

      path: string

      ): [ParsedPath](https://bun.com/reference/node/path/default/ParsedPath);

      Returns an object from a path string - the opposite of format().

      @param path

      path to evaluate.
    - [relative](https://bun.com/reference/node/path/default/PlatformPath/relative)(

      from: string,

      to: string

      ): string;

      Solve the relative path from {from} to {to} based on the current working directory. At times we have two absolute paths, and we need to derive the relative path from one to the other. This is actually the reverse transform of path.resolve.
    - [resolve](https://bun.com/reference/node/path/default/PlatformPath/resolve)(

      ...paths: string[]

      ): string;

      The right-most parameter is considered {to}. Other parameters are considered an array of {from}.

      Starting from leftmost {from} parameter, resolves {to} to an absolute path.

      If {to} isn't already absolute, {from} arguments are prepended in right to left order, until an absolute path is found. If after using all {from} paths still no absolute path is found, the current working directory is used as well. The resulting path is normalized, and trailing slashes are removed unless the path gets resolved to the root directory.

      @param paths

      A sequence of paths or path segments.
    - [toNamespacedPath](https://bun.com/reference/node/path/default/PlatformPath/toNamespacedPath)(

      path: string

      ): string;

      On Windows systems only, returns an equivalent namespace-prefixed path for the given path. If path is not a string, path will be returned without modifications. This method is meaningful only on Windows system. On POSIX systems, the method is non-operational and always returns path without modifications.
