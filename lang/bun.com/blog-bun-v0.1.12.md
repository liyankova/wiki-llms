To upgrade:

```
bun upgrade
```

To install:

```
curl https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

If you have any problems upgrading

Run the install script (you can run it multiple times):

```
curl https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### [`bun install` gets faster & more reliable](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.1.12#bun-install-gets-faster-more-reliable)

Previously, `bun install` on Linux would crash or hang at least 1 out of every 80,000 cold package installs 🙈. It was particularly bad for download speeds < 100 mbps. Sometimes there were DNS hostname resolution issues as well (which caused a separate crash). If you were on a Linux kernel earlier than v5.5 or had a low memlock limit (e.g. using Ubuntu 18.04), it just wouldn't work at all.

Bun v0.1.12 fixes that.

To end-to-end test this, I had a computer cold install 512 MB of `node_modules` for 2 hours in a loop (at least 800,000 cold package installs) and it installed successfully every time without crashing or hanging (unlike Bun v0.1.11 and earlier)

The first run installed 100 times and the second 1,000 times.

Four different things caused stability issues:

* A deadlock in the code that waits for async work to complete (extracting files and parsing JSON happen in a threadpool). This was fixed by (1) moving to a multi-producer single-consumer lockfree queue for HTTP requests and (2) using either a eventfd or a machport to notify readiness instead of a futex.
* A bug in the HTTP client when suspending/resuming from work that occurred asynchronously. This was fixed while rewriting the HTTP client (it no longer uses Zig's async/await)
* A crash when reading an empty JSON file. This was a trivial fix.
* A crash when DNS resolution failed for any reason. This was fixed while rewriting the HTTP client because now it uses libc's `getaddrinfo`

Many of these issues applied to macOS as well (excluding the memlock limit one)

There are still important missing features in `bun install`, including support for `git` dependencies, `github` dependencies, `npm:` package aliasing, and workspaces support. Those are just not implemented yet, which is different than stability issues with existing features.

### [`fetch()` gets faster & more reliable](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.1.12#fetch-gets-faster-more-reliable)

The eventing code for Bun's HTTP client has been rewritten to use [uSockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uSockets) and that, along with changes to concurrent task scheduling and HTTP keep-alive made sending HTTP requests in Bun faster & more reliable.

Bun's [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) can send 155,000 requests per second on Linux x64:

* 24x higher throughput than in Node v18.9.0
* 6.2x higher throughput than in Bun v0.1.11
* 4.5x higher throughput than in Deno v1.25.3[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709451/190843561-050e6273-3043-496e-870c-a97ef6624e0e.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/709451/190843561-050e6273-3043-496e-870c-a97ef6624e0e.png)

[Code](https://gist.github.com/Jarred-Sumner/d1cd803fc33023a4dfa557357613ac84)

The performance of `fetch` in Bun seems to be within 25% of optimized native HTTP benchmarking tools like `oha` and `bombardier` (`autocannon`, the more popular choice, only reaches 60k req/s)

### [`read.u8` in `bun:ffi`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.1.12#read-u8-in-bun-ffi)

`read` in `bun:ffi` lets you read pointers without creating a new DataView. This helps write faster libraries.

```
import { read, ptr } from "bun:ffi";
import { it, expect } from "bun:test";

it("read", () => {
  const buffer = new BigInt64Array(16);
  const dataView = new DataView(buffer.buffer);
  const addr = ptr(buffer);

  for (let i = 0; i < buffer.length; i++) {
    buffer[i] = BigInt(i);
    expect(read.intptr(addr, i * 8)).toBe(
      Number(dataView.getBigInt64(i * 8, true)),
    );
    expect(read.ptr(addr, i * 8)).toBe(
      Number(dataView.getBigUint64(i * 8, true)),
    );
    expect(read.f64(addr, i + 8)).toBe(dataView.getFloat64(i + 8, true));
    expect(read.i64(addr, i * 8)).toBe(dataView.getBigInt64(i * 8, true));
    expect(read.u64(addr, i * 8)).toBe(dataView.getBigUint64(i * 8, true));
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < buffer.byteLength - 4; i++) {
    // read is intended to behave like DataView
    // but instead of doing
    //    new DataView(toArrayBuffer(myPtr)).getInt8(0, true)
    // you can do
    //    read.i8(myPtr, 0)
    expect(read.i8(addr, i)).toBe(dataView.getInt8(i, true));
    expect(read.i16(addr, i)).toBe(dataView.getInt16(i, true));
    expect(read.i32(addr, i)).toBe(dataView.getInt32(i, true));
    expect(read.u8(addr, i)).toBe(dataView.getUint8(i, true));
    expect(read.u16(addr, i)).toBe(dataView.getUint16(i, true));
    expect(read.u32(addr, i)).toBe(dataView.getUint32(i, true));
    expect(read.f32(addr, i)).toBe(dataView.getFloat32(i, true));
  }
});
```

Implementing this involved a change to WebKit's DOMJIT to [enable 52-bit integer arguments (pointers)](https://github.com/oven-sh/WebKit/commit/2e9e9203ef0561f08919285f32d81b25ad96608a)

This involved an unlikely but potentially breaking change to the pointer representation in `bun:ffi`. Previously, `bun:ffi` pointers stored the memory address at the end of a JavaScript double (bit-casted a double to a 64-bit signed integer) and now the value is stored in the integer part of the double. This would only be a breaking change for libraries relying on the pointer representation in napi

### [String.prototype.replace gets 2x faster](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.1.12#string-prototype-replace-gets-2x-faster)

`String.prototype.replace` gets 2x faster in Safari & Bun, thanks to [@Constellation](https://github.com/Constellation). It affects code like this:

```
myString.replace("foo", "baz");
```

PRs:

* https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/4079
* https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/4121
* https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit/pull/3983

This version of Bun updates to the latest WebKit as of September 17th, 2022 (which includes these PRs)

### [Faster `crypto.getRandomValues` and `crypto.randomUUID`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.1.12#faster-crypto-getrandomvalues-and-crypto-randomuuid)

`crypto.getRandomValues` now uses BoringSSL's optimized random functions

Note: this screenshot was taken before Bun's version was bumped to v0.1.12 which is why it shows v0.1.11 there
