[Colin McDonnell](https://twitter.com/colinhacks) · June 9, 2023

We're hiring C/C++ and Zig engineers to build the future of JavaScript! [Join our team →](https://bun.com/careers)

We've been releasing a lot of changes to Bun recently, here's a recap in case you missed it:

* [`v0.6.0`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-bundler) - Introducing `bun build`, Bun's new JavaScript bundler.
* [`v0.6.2`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.2) - Performance boosts: 20% faster `JSON.parse`, up to 2x faster `Proxy` and `arguments`.
* [`v0.6.3`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.3) - Implemented `node:vm`, lots of fixes to `node:http` and `node:tls`.
* [`v0.6.4`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.4) - Implemented `require.cache`, `process.env.TZ`, and 80% faster `bun test`.
* [`v0.6.5`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.5) - Native support for CommonJS modules (*previously, Bun did CJS to ESM transpilation*),
* [`v0.6.6`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.6) - `bun test` improvements, including Github Actions support, `test.only()`, `test.if()`, `describe.skip()`, and 15+ more `expect()` matchers; also streaming file uploads using `fetch()`.
* [`v0.6.7`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.7) - Node.js compatibility improvements to unblock Discord.js, Prisma, and Puppeteer

This release implements a top-level `Bun.password` API for secure password hashing, function mocking & `toMatchObject` in `bun test`, and an experimental `inspector` mode in `Bun.serve()`, in addition to a range of bugfixes and stability improvements. We have also made a breaking change to `bun:sqlite`.

To install Bun:

curl

npm

brew

docker

curl

```
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

npm

```
npm install -g bun
```

brew

```
brew tap oven-sh/bun
```

```
brew install bun
```

docker

```
docker pull oven/bun
```

```
docker run --rm --init --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 oven/bun
```

To upgrade Bun:

```
bun upgrade
```

## [`Bun.password`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.8#bun-password)

Bun now exposes the `Bun.password` API for conveniently hashing passwords in a cryptographically secure way.

```
const password = "super-secure-pa$$word";

const hash = await Bun.password.hash(password);
// => $argon2id$v=19$m=65536,t=2,p=1$tFq+9AVr1bfPxQdh6E8DQRhEXg/M/SqYCNu6gVdRRNs$GzJ8PuBi+K+BVojzPfS5mjnC8OpLGtv8KJqF99eP6a4
```

The hashing algorithm and its parameters are encoded into the returned hash, so hashes can be verified with `Bun.password.verify` with no additional metadata provided.

```
const password = "super-secure-pa$$word";

const hash = await Bun.password.hash(password);
const isMatch = await Bun.password.verify(password, hash);
// => true
```

The default algoritm is `argon2` but `bcrypt` is also supported. Both algorithms can be configured as needed.

```
const password = "super-secure-pa$$word";

// use argon2 (default)
const argonHash = await Bun.password.hash(password, {
  algorithm: "argon2id", // "argon2id" | "argon2i" | "argon2d"
  memoryCost: 4, // memory usage in kibibytes
  timeCost: 3, // the number of iterations
});

// use bcrypt
const bcryptHash = await Bun.password.hash(password, {
  algorithm: "bcrypt",
  cost: 4, // number between 4-31
});
```

When using `bcrypt`, the returned hash is encoded in [Modular Crypt Format](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modular_crypt_format.html) for compatibility with most existing `bcrypt` implementations; with `argon2` the result is encoded in the newer [PHC format](https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-string-format/blob/master/phc-sf-spec.md). Under the hood `Bun.password` uses the `std.crypto.pwhash` module from Zig's standard library.

Refer to [API > Hashing > `Bun.password`](https://bun.sh/docs/api/hashing#bun-password) for complete documentation.

## [Function mocking in `bun test`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.8#function-mocking-in-bun-test)

Bun's test runner now supports function mocking and a couple related `expect()` matchers.

```
import { test, expect, mock } from "bun:test";
const random = mock(() => Math.random());

test("random", async () => {
  const val = random();
  expect(val).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  expect(random).toHaveBeenCalled();
  expect(random).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});
```

The result of `mock()` is a new function that's decorated with some additional properties and methods.

mocking

```
import { mock } from "bun:test";
const random = mock((multiplier: number) => multiplier * Math.random());

random(2);
random(10);

random.mock.calls;
// [[ 2 ], [ 3 ]]

random.mock.results;
//  [
//    { type: "return", value: 0.6533907460954099 },
//    { type: "return", value: 0.6452713933037312 }
//  ]
```

Creating mocks in bun:test is low-overhead and fast. In a benchmark creating 100,000 mocks, bun:test was 80x faster than Jest and 100x faster than Vitest.

### [`jest.spyOn` support](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.8#jest-spyon-support)

Support has been added for Jest's `spyOn` functionality as well. This provides a mechanism for tracking and introspecting method calls.

```
import { test, expect, spyOn } from "bun:test";

const ringo = {
  name: "Ringo",
  sayHi() {
    console.log(`Hello I'm ${this.name}`);
  },
};

const hiMock = spyOn(ringo, "sayHi");

test("spyon", () => {
  expect(hiMock).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(0);
  ringo.sayHi();
  expect(hiMock).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});
```

For ease of migration, a polyfill for the `jest` global is exported from `bun:test`. This polyfill implements `jest.fn` and `jest.spyOn` for codebases that already rely on Jest-style syntax.

```
import { test, expect, jest } from "bun:test";

const mockFn = jest.fn(() => {});

const mockMethod = jest.spyOn(
  {
    random() {
      return Math.random();
    },
  },
  "random",
);
```

Support has been added for the `.toHaveBeenCalled()` and `.toHaveBeenCalledTimes()` matchers. Contributors are welcome to submit PRs for additional matchers like `.toHaveBeenCalledWith()` and `.toHaveBeenLastCalledWith()`.

We haven't added support for module mocks yet. Stay tuned for that in a future release, though I'm pretty sure we can make it work for both CommonJS and ES Modules using the same API.

### [toMatchObject](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.8#tomatchobject)

The `toMatchObject` matcher has been added to `bun:test`. This matcher is useful for asserting that an object contains a subset of properties.

```
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("toMatchObject", () => {
  const obj = {
    a: 1,
    b: 2,
    c: 3,
  };

  expect(obj).toMatchObject({
    a: 1,
    b: 2,
  });
  expect(obj).not.toMatchObject({
    c: 4,
  });
});
```

You can also use `toMatchObject` with asymmetric matchers like `expect.stringContaining` and `expect.any(Number)`:

```
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("toMatchObject", () => {
  const obj = {
    a: "hello",
    b: "world",
  };

  expect(obj).toMatchObject({
    a: expect.stringContaining("ell"),
    b: expect.any(String),
  });
});
```

## [(breaking) bun:sqlite's `.values()` method now returns `[]` instead of `null`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.8#breaking-bun-sqlite-s-values-method-now-returns-instead-of-null)

Previously, the following returned `null` due to no matching rows:

```
db.query("SELECT * FROM foo WHERE id > 9999").values();
// null
```

As of Bun v0.6.8, it returns `[]`:

```
db.query("SELECT * FROM foo WHERE id > 9999").values();
// []
```

This [aligns with the behavior](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm/issues/711) of other functions and other SQLite3 libraries.

```
db.query("SELECT * FROM foo WHERE id > 9999").all(); // []
db.query("SELECT * FROM foo WHERE id > 9999").values(); // [] (previously: null)
```

We conducted a Twitter poll and 75% voted in favor of the breaking change.

> calling .values() on a bun:sqlite query with 0 results returns null instead of []  
>   
> keep the confusing API the same or make the breaking change?

## [Experimental `inspector` mode in `Bun.serve`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.8#experimental-inspector-mode-in-bun-serve)

Bun's HTTP server now provides an "inspector" mode. To enable it, set `inspector: true`. Setting `NODE_ENV=production` disables inspector mode, regardless of the value passed into `Bun.serve`.

```
Bun.serve({
  inspector: true,
  fetch(req) {
    // handle request
  },
});
```

This mounts a WebSocket-based debugger at `localhost:$PORT/bun:inspect` that can process messages conforming to WebKit's debugger protocol. This is a first step towards a more advanced browser-side debugging experience when developing full-stack applications with Bun.

[This gist](https://gist.github.com/Jarred-Sumner/c4dc26ac5d61588992e4f5b61c12cfb4) provides a simple but functional implementation of an in-browser "REPL" that can execute code server-side and retrieve the results over WebSockets.

[![](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/assets/3084745/66acd880-fc79-45d6-93c2-10cdf130b5cf)](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/assets/3084745/66acd880-fc79-45d6-93c2-10cdf130b5cf)

A simple over-the-wire REPL.

To make it easier to develop tooling that targets the WebKit debugger protocol, we've published [`bun-devtools`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bun-devtools) to `npm`, which provides auto-generated Typecript types for the protocol's actions, logs, and more.

```
import { JSC } from "bun-devtools";
```

## [Transpiler & Bundler bugfixes](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.8#transpiler-bundler-bugfixes)

We fixed a few things in the bundler & transpiler

### [lodash-es/isBuffer failed to bundle](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.8#lodash-es-isbuffer-failed-to-bundle)

The `lodash-es` export `isBuffer` was failing to run due to an edgecase with CommonJS and ES Module interop.

The following from `lodash-es/isBuffer.js`:

```
import root from "./_root.js";
import stubFalse from "./stubFalse.js";

var freeExports =
  typeof exports == "object" && exports && !exports.nodeType && exports;

var freeModule =
  freeExports &&
  typeof module == "object" &&
  module &&
  !module.nodeType &&
  module;

var moduleExports = freeModule && freeModule.exports === freeExports;
var Buffer = moduleExports ? root.Buffer : undefined;
var nativeIsBuffer = Buffer ? Buffer.isBuffer : undefined;

var isBuffer = nativeIsBuffer || stubFalse;

export default isBuffer;
```

The `typeof` check for `module` and `exports` is incorrect because the module is always an ES Module, so `module` and `exports` are always undefined. The usage of CommonJS identifiers caused Bun to treat it as a CommonJS module, which caused a runtime exception. That has been fixed.

However, the `isBuffer` function in `lodash-es` remains broken in both Node.js & Bun (it always returns `false`). We have filed an issue with [`lodash-es`](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/5660).

### [\r\n normalization in tagged template literals](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.8#r-n-normalization-in-tagged-template-literals)

Bun was incorrectly normalizing Windows newlines in tagged template literals in certain cases. This has been fixed.

### [`v` flag in RegExp](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.8#v-flag-in-regexp)

Bun was incorrectly throwing a syntax error when the `v` flag was used in a RegExp literal. The `v` flag is a [stage4 TC39 proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-v-flag).

## [bun install bugfix for workspace lifecycle scripts](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.8#bun-install-bugfix-for-workspace-lifecycle-scripts)

bun install now runs lifecycle scripts for workspace packages. Previously, only the root package's lifecycle scripts were run.

Thanks to [@alexlamsl](https://github.com/alexlamsl) for the fix!

## [console.log(myBuffer) shows Buffer instead of Uint8Array](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.8#console-log-mybuffer-shows-buffer-instead-of-uint8array)

Previously, `console.log` would show `Uint8Array` instead of `Buffer` for `Buffer` instances. This has been fixed.

```
const buf = Buffer.from("hello world");
console.log(buf);
```

Previously:

```
Uint8Array(11) [ 104, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 119, 111, 114, 108, 100 ]
```

Now:

```
Buffer(11) [ 104, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 119, 111, 114, 108, 100 ]
```
