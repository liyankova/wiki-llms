# Generate a yarn-compatible lockfile - Bun

Bun v1.1.39 introduced `bun.lock`, a JSONC formatted lockfile. `bun.lock` is human-readable and git-diffable without
configuration, at no cost to performance. In 1.2.0+ it is the default format used for new projects. [**Learn
more.**](https://bun.com/docs/pm/lockfile#text-based-lockfile)

---

Use the `--yarn` flag to generate a Yarn-compatible `yarn.lock` file (in addition to `bun.lock{b}`).

terminal

Copy

```
bun install --yarn
```

---

To set this as the default behavior, add the following to your `bunfig.toml` file.

bunfig.toml

Copy

```
[install.lockfile]
print = "yarn"
```

---

To print a Yarn lockfile to your console without writing it to disk, “run” your `bun.lockb` with `bun`.

terminal

Copy

```
bun bun.lockb
```

Copy

```
