**Note** — We're [hiring](https://bun.com/careers) C/C++ and Zig engineers to build the future of JavaScript!

Happy Holidays! We're excited to release Bun v0.4.0 with support for more Node.js APIs, increased stability, lots of bug fixes, and a new command: `bunx`.

## [Introducing `bunx`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.4.0#introducing-bunx)

This version introduces `bunx`, Bun's equivalent of `npx` with 100x faster startup times. It runs [executables](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#bin) from local or remote npm packages.

```
bunx esbuild --version
```

As with `npx`, it will check for a locally installed package first, then fall back to auto-installing from npm into a shared global cache. With Bun's fast startup times, it's roughly 100x faster than `npx` for locally installed packages.

## [The `--bun` flag](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.4.0#the-bun-flag)

By default, Bun respects the `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang at the top of scripts or executables that are run with `bun run <script>` or `bunx <command>`.

```
// foo.js
#! /usr/bin/env node

console.log(process.argv[0]);
```

```
bun run foo.js
```

```
/path/to/node/19.2.0/bin/node
```

To override this behavior, pass the `--bun` flag. This temporarily aliases `node` to `bun` for the duration of the execution.

```
bun --bun run foo.js
```

```
/path/to/.bun/bin/bun
```

In the future, we might make this behaviour the default once Bun's Node.js compatibility is more complete.

## [Node.js compatibility](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.4.0#node-js-compatibility)

Support for Node.js APIs continues to be a top priority for Bun. As of Bun v0.4.0, you can now use the following APIs:

* [`crypto.timingSafeEqual()`](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#cryptotimingsafeequala-b)
* [`crypto.scryptSync()`](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#cryptoscryptsyncpassword-salt-keylen-options)
* [`process.abort()`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#processabort)
* [`process.argv0`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#processargv0) and [`process.execPath`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#processexecpath)
* [`node:util/types`](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#utiltypes)

## [Setup and teardown in `bun:test`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.4.0#setup-and-teardown-in-bun-test)

Bun has a built-in test runner that you can run using the command: `bun wiptest`. You can now define [Jest-style](https://jestjs.io/docs/setup-teardown) lifecycle hooks for the setup and teardown of tests.

```
import { beforeAll, test } from "bun:test";

let tests;
beforeAll(async () => {
  const response = await fetch("https://example.com/path/to/resource");
  tests = await response.json();
});

test("that integration tests are defined", () => {
  expect(tests).toHaveLength(100);
});
```

## [`Bun.deepEquals()` strict](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.4.0#bun-deepequals-strict)

You can now pass a `strict` argument to `Bun.deepEquals()`, which will have the same behaviour as [`expect().toStrictEqual()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect#tostrictequalvalue).

```
const a = { entries: [1, 2] };
const b = { entries: [1, 2], extra: undefined };

Bun.deepEquals(a, b); // => true
Bun.deepEquals(a, b, true); // => false
```

## [`bun pm`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.4.0#bun-pm)

In case you missed it, Bun has a command that allows you see information about your packages and lockfile in a project: `bun pm`.

[![Output of "bun pm"](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3238291/209288829-d2efc679-6bea-4018-9b33-3aa8024b12eb.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3238291/209288829-d2efc679-6bea-4018-9b33-3aa8024b12eb.png)

### [`bun pm ls`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.4.0#bun-pm-ls)

In Bun v0.4.0 there is new sub-command, `bun pm ls`, which will list all the packages and versions in your project, similar to `npm ls`.
