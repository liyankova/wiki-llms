Bun v0.5.5 improves Node.js compatibility for [`node:http`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http), adds support for [`http.request()`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httprequesturl-options-callback), and fixes various bugs.

```
# Install using curl
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Install using npm
npm install -g bun

# Upgrade
bun upgrade
```

## [`node:http`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.5#node-http)

The following `node:http` APIs are now supported in Bun:

* [`http.request()`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httprequesturl-options-callback)
* [`http.ClientRequest`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpclientrequest)
* [`http.OutgoingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpoutgoingmessage)
* [`http.Agent`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpagent) (some features are stubbed out, for now)

This enables several npm packages, including [`stripe`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node), to now work in Bun!

Thanks @ThatOneBro for landing this feature!

## [Fixed duplicate `bun install` dependencies](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.5#fixed-duplicate-bun-install-dependencies)

We also fixed a [bug](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/1952) where `bun install` would crash if your machine had more than 8 versions of the same dependency installed. We have some plans to make our `bun install` testing suite more robust to catch errors like this in the future.

Thanks @alexlamsl for debugging this issue and landing a fix.
