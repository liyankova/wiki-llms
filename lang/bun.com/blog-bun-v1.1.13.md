## [`node:worker_threads` now supports `eval: true`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#node-worker-threads-now-supports-eval-true)

Similar to the web standards, `node:worker_threads` has a feature to allow taking a string of source code.

node-worker-eval.ts

```
import * as wt from 'node:worker_threads';
const code = `
  import { parentPort } from 'node:worker_threads';
  const foo: number = 123;
  parentPort.postMessage({ foo } satisfies Data);
`;
const worker = new wt.Worker(code, { eval: true });
worker.on('message', data => {
  console.log(data);
});
```

```
bun node-worker-eval.ts
```

```
{
  foo: 123,
}
```

## [Implemented `URL.createObjectURL`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#implemented-url-createobjecturl)

Bun now supports `URL.createObjectURL`, which creates a URL from a Blob object. These urls can then be used in APIs like `fetch`, `Worker`, and `import`.

When combined with `Worker`, it allows for an easy way to spawn additional threads without creating a new separate URL for the worker's script. Since worker scripts also run through Bun's transpiler, TypeScript syntax is supported.

worker-object-url.ts

```
const code = `
  const foo: number = 123;
  postMessage({ foo } satisfies Data);
`;
const blob = new File([code], "hey.ts");
const url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
const worker = new Worker(url);
worker.onmessage = ({data}) => {
  console.log("data:", data);
};
```

```
bun worker-object-url.ts
```

```
{
  foo: 123,
}
```

## [`expect` supports custom failure messages](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#expect-supports-custom-failure-messages)

Bun now supports custom failure messages by passing a string as the second argument to `expect`. This works the same as it does in Vitest, allowing you to document what the assertion is checking.

custom-message.test.ts

```
import { test, expect } from 'bun:test';

test("sample", () => {
  expect(0.1 + 0.2, "Floating point has precision error").toBe(0.3);
});
```

```
 $ bun test custom-message
 bun test v1.1.12 (43f0913c)

 test.test.ts:
 1 | import { test, expect } from 'bun:test';
 2 |
 3 | test("sample", () => {
 4 |   expect(0.1 + 0.2, "Floating point has precision error").toBe(0.3);
                                                               ^
-error: expect(received).toBe(expected)
+error: Floating point has precision error

 Expected: 0.3
 Received: 0.30000000000000004

 at /private/tmp/scratchpad_20240606T054447/test.test.ts:4:3
 ✗ sample [1.94ms]
```

This is most useful when the value evaluates to a boolean. Instead of just seeing "Expected true, recieved false", tests can make it immediatly obvious what the error is.

## [Bun install reliability](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#bun-install-reliability)

This release includes several reliability improvements to `bun install`.

### [Fixed: Crash when certain peer dependencies install](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fixed-crash-when-certain-peer-dependencies-install)

When certain peer dependencies are installed and not present in the cache, Bun would potentially crash. This crash has been reported 167 times.

Thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) for fixing this!

### [Fixed: Manifest cache string deduplicating bugfix](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fixed-manifest-cache-string-deduplicating-bugfix)

When a dependency name and a dependency version existed in the same npm registry manifest file, Bun would potentially deduplicate the strings incorrectly, leading Bun to attempt to download the wrong package. This bug is pretty rare - you would have to have a dependency name that is also a version number, or the version number would have be the same as a dependency name (like an npm tag named "react" and a dependency named "react" in the same registry manifest api response).

Thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) for fixing this!

### [Fixed: Semver parsing edge case with prerelease tags](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fixed-semver-parsing-edge-case-with-prerelease-tags)

A bug in Bun's semver parser has been fixed, thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway). This bug would cause invalid semver to sometimes successfully install versions with prerelease tags if `.` immediately followed the patch number. For example, `1.0.0.alpha` would parse as `1.0.0-alpha` and install if that version existed.

### [Fixed: Crash and assertion failure when printing bun.lockb in yarn.lock format](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fixed-crash-and-assertion-failure-when-printing-bun-lockb-in-yarn-lock-format)

A crash when running `bun bun.lockb` has been resolved thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway). This the assertion failure would sometimes occur when packages had the same dependency in `"dependencies"` and `"optionalDependencies"` in their `package.json`.

### [Fixed: Npm package manifest validation bugfix](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fixed-npm-package-manifest-validation-bugfix)

Bun install uses npm manifest files to retrieve package information and determine what dependencies need to be installed. When receiving these manifests, Bun will make sure the `"name"` property matches the package name from the request, and error if it does not. This fix allows scoped packages to be url encoded, where possibly `@` or `/` could be replaced with `%40` or `%2F`.

```
{
  "name": "%40foo%2fbar"
  // ...
}
```

Thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) for fixing this!

### [Fixed: Package manifest cache bugfix](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fixed-package-manifest-cache-bugfix)

A bug where a re-install of `node_modules` could fail when switching between projects using different default or scoped registries has been fixed.

Thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) for fixing this!

### [Fixed: Installing git dependencies with missing package.json files or `"name"` fields](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fixed-installing-git-dependencies-with-missing-package-json-files-or-name-fields)

Bun will now successfully install git dependencies that do not have a package.json file committed, or have a package.json file without a `"name"` field. The dependency name will be the repository name in these situations.

Thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) for fixing this!

### [Fixed: Aliased workspace dependencies fix](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fixed-aliased-workspace-dependencies-fix)

A bug preventing aliased workspace dependencies without a version in their package.json has been fixed. For example, this workspace dependency will now work as expected:

```
// ./packages/foo/package.json
{
  "name": "foo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "is-odd": "workspace:is-even@latest"
  }
}

// ./packages/is-even/package.json
{
  "name": "is-even",
}
```

Thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway)

### [Incorrect manifest cache invalidation optimization](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#incorrect-manifest-cache-invalidation-optimization)

We've disabled an optimization in `bun install` that would cause `bun install` to potentially hang or receive "Connection closed" errors.

npm's registry api returns a `Last-Modified` header, but ignores `If-Not-Modified-Since` header. When the `Last-Modified` header matched the stored value, Bun would ignore the remaining response body and pretend a 304 was returned. This skips donwloading, decompressing, and parsing the manifest JSON unnecessarily. However, the implementation of this optimization needs to be more robust to handle HTTP keep-alive correctly. For now, we've disabled this optimization.

## [5 new bun:test matchers](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#5-new-bun-test-matchers)

This release adds 5 new matchers to `bun:test`:

* `toContainAllKeys`
* `toContainValue`
* `toContainValues`
* `toContainAllValues`
* `toContainAnyValues`

These matchers are useful for testing if objects contain or have specific keys or values.

```
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("hello", () => {
  expect({ a: "hello", b: "world" }).toContainAllKeys(["a", "b"]);
  expect({ a: "hello", b: "world" }).toContainValue("hello");
  expect({ a: "hello", b: "world" }).toContainValues(["hello", "world"]);
  expect({ a: "hello", b: "world" }).toContainAllValues(["hello", "world"]);
  expect({ a: "hello", b: "world" }).toContainAnyValues(["world"]);
});
```

Thanks to [@nithinkjoy\_tech](https://github.com/nithinkjoy_tech) for adding these matchers!

## [`fetch` stability improvement](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fetch-stability-improvement)

We fixed a bug where if you sent thousands of concurrent HTTP requests in a short time frame, some would fail with `The socket connection was closed unexpectedly`.

The cause of this was due to Bun's handling of TCP FIN packets. After receiving a TCP FIN packet, Bun now sets `SO_LINGER` on the socket to `0`, causing it to immediately close instead of risking getting stuck in the `TIME_WAIT` state and then running out of socket descriptors.

## [Fix stack trace line/column numbers being offset](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fix-stack-trace-line-column-numbers-being-offset)

The code bun uses to remap errors to their original line and column number had some very subtle edge cases. The shortest reproduction was from `strictEqual`.

```
import { strictEqual } from "node:assert";

(function () {});

strictEqual(1, 2);
```

Which would point to the wrong position.

```
1 | import { strictEqual } from 'node:assert';
2 |
3 | (function () { })
     ^
AssertionError: Expected values to be strictly equal:
    at module code (/tmp/scratchpad/index.ts:3:2)
```

Thanks to [@paperclover](https://github.com/paperclover), this entire class of bug has been fixed by fixing a mistake in how line and column numbers are read from JavaScriptCore. The error divot, the printed stack trace, and `error.stack` all point to the correct source location.

```
3 | (function () { })
4 |
5 | strictEqual(1, 2);
    ^
AssertionError: Expected values to be strictly equal:
    at module code (/tmp/scratchpad/index.ts:5:1)
```

This is important because when using `bun build --target=bun --sourcemap --minify`, all source code gets placed on one line, which can cause errors to point to positions in the file which don't even exist.

## [Minify `Infinity`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#minify-infinity)

When bundling with `--minify-syntax`, the `Infinity` constant will be shortened into `1/0`

infinity.ts

```
console.log(Infinity);
```

```
bun build infinity.ts --minify
```

```
console.log(1/0);
```

## [WebSocket server reliability improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#websocket-server-reliability-improvements)

This release fixes three rare bugs in Bun's WebSocket server:

1. A crash could occur when the socket connection hung up unexpectedly in a specific code path. We did not see reports of this, but did notice it in debug builds of Bun.
2. A case of undefined behavior in the WebSocket server when sending a large message without compression, without TLS, and with no backpressure has been fixed. We have not seen any reports of this causing a crash or data corruption.
3. A crash when passing invalid argument types to `isSubscribed`, `subscribe`, or `unsubscribe` has been fixed. This could also happen if the machine ran out of memory. This issue was reported 1 time.

A bug where the following code would close the connection immediately has been fixed:

```
import type { ServerWebSocket } from "bun";

const delay = (ms: number) => new Promise((ok) => setTimeout(ok, ms));

Bun.serve<{}>({
  fetch: async (req, server) => {
    await delay(1);

    if (server.upgrade(req)) return;
  },
  websocket: {
    open(ws: ServerWebSocket<{}>): void | Promise<void> {
      console.log("open");
    },
    close(
      ws: ServerWebSocket<{}>,
      code: number,
      reason: string,
    ): void | Promise<void> {
      console.log("closed", code);
    },
  },
});

new WebSocket("http://localhost:3000", "ocpp1.6");
```

Thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari) for fixing this!

### [Fixed: UTF16 Content-Type header in WebSocket server](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fixed-utf16-content-type-header-in-websocket-server)

If the JavaScript string for `"Content-Type"` was encoded as UTF-16, Bun would not read it correctly. This has been fixed, thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari).

### [Fixed: WebSocket memory leak on close](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fixed-websocket-memory-leak-on-close)

A memory leak when closing WebSockets has been fixed, thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari)!

## [Fixed: `AbortSignal.any()` bugfix](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fixed-abortsignal-any-bugfix)

A bug causing signals from `AbortSignal.any()` to not receive an abort event for each dependent signal has been fixed, thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari)!

The following code will now work as expected:

```
const controller = new AbortController();

const signal = AbortSignal.any([controller.signal]);

signal.addEventListener("abort", () => {
  console.log("aborted!");
});

controller.abort();
```

## [Faster crypto.pbkdf2](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#faster-crypto-pbkdf2)

We've reimplemented `crypto.pkdf2` to use optimized BoringSSL functions instead of a JavaScript polyfill implementation.

New:

```
cpu: Apple M3 Max
runtime: bun 1.1.13 (arm64-darwin)

benchmark                                         time (avg)             (min … max)       p75       p99      p995
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------
pbkdf2(iterations = 1000, 'sha256') -> 32       81.5 µs/iter  (69.67 µs … 823.54 µs)   81.5 µs  100.5 µs 110.08 µs
pbkdf2(iterations = 500_000, 'sha256') -> 32   31.74 ms/iter   (31.16 ms … 33.28 ms)  31.83 ms  33.28 ms  33.28 ms
```

Previously:

```
cpu: Apple M3 Max
runtime: bun 1.1.10 (arm64-darwin)

benchmark                                         time (avg)             (min … max)       p75       p99      p995
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------
pbkdf2(iterations = 1000, 'sha256') -> 32       2.37 ms/iter     (2.05 ms … 5.15 ms)   2.26 ms   5.06 ms   5.06 ms
pbkdf2(iterations = 500_000, 'sha256') -> 32     1.24 s/iter       (1.22 s … 1.26 s)    1.25 s    1.26 s    1.26 s
```

Node.js, for comparison:

```
cpu: Apple M3 Max
runtime: node v22.2.0 (arm64-darwin)

benchmark                                         time (avg)             (min … max)       p75       p99      p995
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -----------------------------
pbkdf2(iterations = 1000, 'sha256') -> 32     213.68 µs/iter   (195.08 µs … 2.35 ms) 217.33 µs 274.71 µs 289.21 µs
pbkdf2(iterations = 500_000, 'sha256') -> 32   104.6 ms/iter  (97.97 ms … 114.64 ms) 110.37 ms 114.64 ms 114.64 ms
```

## [Fixed: `structuredClone(File)`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fixed-structuredclone-file)

`structuredClone` now supports `File` objects, which are used in `postMessage`.

structured-clone.ts

```
const blob = new File(["hello"], "hello.txt");
const cloned = structuredClone(blob);
console.log(cloned.name === "hello.txt"); // true
// Previously: false
```

Thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) for fixing this!

## [Fixed: Worker `.terminate()` stability improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fixed-worker-terminate-stability-improvements)

A crash has been fixed with terminating `Worker`s. This was caused by a race condition with pending work (such as `fetch`, async `node:fs`, and `Bun.serve`) while the termination was in progress.

## [Fixed: `node:https` client bug with custom `checkServerIdentity`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fixed-node-https-client-bug-with-custom-checkserveridentity)

When using `node:https` or `tls:connect` with a custom `checkServerIdentity` function, a race condition could potentially cause the function to never be called. This bug has been fixed.

This does not impact the default `checkServerIdentity` function, as that takes a completely separate code path.

## [Fixed: Crashes during `bun update` with unresolved packages](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fixed-crashes-during-bun-update-with-unresolved-packages)

A crash when updating peer dependencies has been resolved where during an update a `invalid_package_id` was seen, indicating the package was not yet resolved. Previously, we assumed at this stage that packages were always resolved, but an edge case with peer dependencies can leave this unresolved.

Thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway)

## [Fixed: Windows command line parsing crash](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fixed-windows-command-line-parsing-crash)

A crash relating to invalid utf16 in windows command line strings has been resolved.

## [Fixed: `bun update` preserves `~` version specifiers](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fixed-bun-update-preserves-version-specifiers)

If a package.json specified a dependency version such as `~1.1.0`, the `~` will be preserved after the update. Previously, this was only done for `^` ranges.

package.json

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    // Before running `bun update`
    "elysia": "~1.0.21",

    // After `bun update`
    "elysia": "~1.0.21",
    "elysia": "~1.0.22",
  }
}
```

Thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway)

## [Fixed: Bun Shell fixes](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fixed-bun-shell-fixes)

A couple bugs involving invalid UTF-16 and `Bun.$.escape` have been fixed, along with a panic when a command name expands to an empty string.

These are fixed to [@zackradisic](https://github.com/zackradisic)

## [Fixed: `Bun.deepEquals` with undefined values edge case](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fixed-bun-deepequals-with-undefined-values-edge-case)

Comparing two objects with `Bun.deepEquals` would sometimes incorrectly return `true` if one of the objects had undefined properties and the other had the same number of properties.

```
console.log(Bun.deepEquals({ a: undefined }, { b: 1 })); // true
```

This is fixed thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway)

## [Fixed: `bun create` typo fix](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fixed-bun-create-typo-fix)

`bun create` using a local template will suggest to run `cd` with a relative path to the created project. When the destination was the current directory, it would suggest running `cd` with no arguments.

```
$ bun create elysia
Created elysia project successfully

# To get started, run:

- cd
  bun run src/index.ts
```

Thanks to [@Sushants-Git](https://github.com/Sushants-Git)

## [Fixed: `bun create` with a local folder template on Windows](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fixed-bun-create-with-a-local-folder-template-on-windows)

Previously, creating a project using a local template on Windows did not work. This has been resolved.

Thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) for fixing this.

Bun's help menu includes example packages to use with `bun create`, `bun add`. At some point, the random lists used for these got swapped.

## [Improved error message for `Bun.serve` when passed a non-`Response` object](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#improved-error-message-for-bun-serve-when-passed-a-non-response-object)

When passing a non-`Response` object to `Bun.serve`, Bun will now throw an error with a more helpful message.

```
// Before:
error: Expected a Response object

// After:
error: Expected a Response object, but received '{}'

## [Fixed: `node:crypto` `randomInt` callback](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fixed-node-crypto-randomint-callback)

`node:crypto`'s `randomInt` function now correctly accepts a callback with the random number.

```
import crypto from "crypto";

crypto.randomInt(0, 5000, (err, val) => {
  console.log(val);
});
```

This is fixed thanks to [@nektro](https://github.com/nektro)

## [Fixed: Classes won't emit unnecessary constructor functions](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.13#fixed-classes-won-t-emit-unnecessary-constructor-functions)

When bundling TypeScript, Bun will no longer emit an empty constructor for extended classes. This reduces bundle sizes, and speeds up class construction, as this constructor would hit a slow path in JavaScriptCore.

```
class A {
  constructor(argument) {
    console.log(`Hello ${argument}`);
  }
}

class B extends A {}

new B("World");
```

```
 // index.ts
 class A {
   constructor(argument) {
     console.log(`Hello ${argument}`);
   }
 }

 class B extends A {
-  constructor() {
-    super(...arguments);
- }
 }
 new B("World");
```
