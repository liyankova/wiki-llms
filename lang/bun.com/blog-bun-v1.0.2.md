[Jarred Sumner](https://twitter.com/jarredsumner) · September 15, 2023

Bun v1.0.2 fixes numerous bugs and makes `bun --watch` faster.

Thank you for reporting issues. We are working hard to fix them as quickly as possible.

Bun is an incredibly fast JavaScript runtime, bundler, transpiler, and package manager — all in one. We've been releasing a lot of changes to Bun recently. Here's a recap of the last few releases. In case you missed it:

* [`v1.0.0`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0) - Bun's first stable release!
* [`v1.0.1`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.1) - Named imports for .json & .toml files, bugfixes to bun install, node:path, Buffer

To install Bun:

curl

npm

brew

docker

curl

```
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

npm

```
npm install -g bun
```

brew

```
brew tap oven-sh/bun
```

```
brew install bun
```

docker

```
docker pull oven/bun
```

```
docker run --rm --init --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 oven/bun
```

To upgrade Bun:

```
bun upgrade
```

### [`bunx <package>@latest` always fetches the latest](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.2#bunx-package-latest-always-fetches-the-latest)

Previously, `bunx package@latest` would only fetch the latest version of the package if it had not been installed previously in the `/tmp` folder (which is cleared every 3 days or on restart, dpending on your OS).

Now, `bunx package@latest` will always fetch the latest version of the package. If there is an `@` tag and that tag is not a number, it will fetch the query the npm registry for the matching version of the package.

[#5346](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/5346)

### [Faster `bun --watch`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.2#faster-bun-watch)

`bun --watch <./path-to-file.ts>` lets you watch a file and re-run it when it or any of its imports change. This is useful for development.

Previously, `bun --watch` would enqueue a task to the event loop on change to reload the process. That means any blocking or long-running tasks would delay the reload.

Now, it reloads immediately.

In this gif, the current timestamp in milliseconds is printed to the console on restart.

### [`bun run --silent` no longer prints error messages](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.2#bun-run-silent-no-longer-prints-error-messages)

When running:

```
bun run --silent bash -c 'exit 1'
```

Before:

```
error: "bash" exited with code 1
```

After:

```
# nothing!
```

### [Bun now uses V8's `Date` parser](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.2#bun-now-uses-v8-s-date-parser)

Bun now uses V8's Date parser. This means that date parsing behaves the same in Bun as it does in Chrome and Node.js.

Previously:

```
Date.parse("2020-09-21 15:19:06 +00:00"); // Invalid Date
```

After:

```
Date.parse("2020-09-21 15:19:06 +00:00"); // 1600701546000
```

This fixes a number of bugs where date parsing would fail in Bun but work in Node.js.

### [`URL.canParse` is implemented](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.2#url-canparse-is-implemented)

The `URL` class now has a static `canParse` method, which returns `true` if the URL can be parsed, and `false` otherwise.

```
URL.canParse("https://example.com"); // true
URL.canParse("https://example.com:8080"); // true
URL.canParse("apoksd!"); // false
```

[`URL.canParse`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/canParse_static) is a relatively new addition to the Web Platform. At the time of writing, it is not available in Chrome or Firefox yet.

### [`URLSearchParams.prototype.size` is implemented](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.2#urlsearchparams-prototype-size-is-implemented)

The `URLSearchParams` class now has a `size` property, which returns the number of key/value pairs in the search params.

```
const params = new URLSearchParams("a=1&b=2&c=3");
params.size; // 3
```

[`URLSearchParams.prototype.size`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams/size) is a relatively new addition to the Web Platform.

### [Bugfix to `bun run`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.2#bugfix-to-bun-run)

Previously, `bun run` would always load tsconfig.json files. This meant that having an invalid tsconfig.json file could cause `bun run` to fail, which was completely unnecessary. THis has been fixed.

### [Bugfix to `node:stream`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.2#bugfix-to-node-stream)

When `encoding` was passed to the `write` function, the `callback` would not be called. This has been fixed.

[#75b5c715405d49b5026c13143efecd580d27be1b](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/commit/75b5c715405d49b5026c13143efecd580d27be1b)

### [Bugfix to fetch with a `data:` URL](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.2#bugfix-to-fetch-with-a-data-url)

Previously, invalid `data:` URLs would throw an exception in `fetch`. This was inconsistent with Node.js which would leave the incorrect data in the URL. This has been fixed, thanks to [@davidmhewitt](https://github.com/davidmhewitt).

[#c3455c0ceee6bbe399781819a42fff6cf24792e2](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/commit/c3455c0ceee6bbe399781819a42fff6cf24792e2)

### [Bugfix to `node:readline` (arrow keys)](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.2#bugfix-to-node-readline-arrow-keys)

A bug in `node:readline` causing the terminal to hang on WSL has been fixed.

[#5345](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/5435)

### [Bugfix to `node:dns`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.2#bugfix-to-node-dns)

A crash in `node:dns`'s `resolve` function has been fixed, thanks to [@Hanaasagi](https://github.com/Hanaasagi).

[#5200](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/5200)

### [`os.availableParallelism` is implemented](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.2#os-availableparallelism-is-implemented)

The `node:os` module now has an [`availableParallelism`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_availableparallelism) property, which returns the number of logical CPUs available to the process.

```
os.availableParallelism(); // 8
```

You can also use `navigator.hardwareConcurrency`.

### [Bugfixes to `Bun.serve()`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.2#bugfixes-to-bun-serve)

A crash that could occur when a ReadableStream has enqueued all data before the stream has begun being read has been fixed. This crash happened because the code was missing a check for whether or not a JavaScript function was a callable object.

[#5321](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/5321)

A crash that could occur when calling `req.formData()` has been fixed

[#4966](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/4966)

### [Fix `set-cookie`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.2#fix-set-cookie)

A bug causing the `set-cookie` header to be set incorrectly in `node:http` in some cases has been fixed. This causes issues with Express.js.

[#5183](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/5183)

### [`node:fs` functions are now concurrent](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.2#node-fs-functions-are-now-concurrent)

Previously, only a handful of `node:fs` functions were concurrent. Now, all of them are.

### [Deletable `setTimeout` & other globals](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.2#deletable-settimeout-other-globals)

Most globals are now configurable/deletable, which fixes issues impacting some libraries and ExecJS.

### [Bugfix for fastify](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.2#bugfix-for-fastify)

Fastify loops over `require.cache` during initialization. `require.cache` previously included ES Modules which have not finished evaluating yet and that partially broke Fastify. This has been fixed.

### [Bugfix for multiline string in CRLF terminated files](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.2#bugfix-for-multiline-string-in-crlf-terminated-files)

Thanks to [@tikotzky](https://github.com/tikotzky) for the fix.

[#5318](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/5318)

### [Bugfix for `Bun.file()`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.2#bugfix-for-bun-file)

When the length of the file was less than the size of the `Bun.file()`, the file would sometimes not finish reading. This has been fixed, thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari).

[#5186](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/5186)

### [Bugfix for `node:tty`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.2#bugfix-for-node-tty)

A bug causing `WritableStream.prototype.getColorDepth` to sometimes throw an exception has been fixed.

[#5468](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/5468)

### [Transpiler bugfix for escaping non-ascii `RegExp` literals to latin1](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.2#transpiler-bugfix-for-escaping-non-ascii-regexp-literals-to-latin1)

[#5468](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/5468)

### [Internal changes](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.2#internal-changes)

We upgraded from LLVM 15->16 & Clang 15->16.
