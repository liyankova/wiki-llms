# Node.js crypto module | API Reference | Bun

Node.js module

# [crypto](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto)

The `'node:crypto'` module provides cryptographic functionality, including wrappers for OpenSSL's hash, HMAC, cipher, decipher, sign, verify, and key derivation functions.

It supports common algorithms such as SHA-256, AES, RSA, ECDH, and more. The module also offers secure random number generation, key management, and certificate handling, making it essential for implementing secure protocols and data encryption.

Works in Bun

Most crypto functionality is implemented, but some specific methods related to engine configuration, FIPS mode, and secure heap usage are missing.

* ### class [Cipheriv](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv)

  Instances of the `Cipheriv` class are used to encrypt data. The class can be used in one of two ways:

  + As a `stream` that is both readable and writable, where plain unencrypted data is written to produce encrypted data on the readable side, or
  + Using the `cipher.update()` and `cipher.final()` methods to produce the encrypted data.

  The createCipheriv method is used to create `Cipheriv` instances. `Cipheriv` objects are not to be created directly using the `new` keyword.

  Example: Using `Cipheriv` objects as streams:

  ```
  const {
    scrypt,
    randomFill,
    createCipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';

  // First, we'll generate the key. The key length is dependent on the algorithm.
  // In this case for aes192, it is 24 bytes (192 bits).
  scrypt(password, 'salt', 24, (err, key) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    // Then, we'll generate a random initialization vector
    randomFill(new Uint8Array(16), (err, iv) => {
      if (err) throw err;

      // Once we have the key and iv, we can create and use the cipher...
      const cipher = createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

      let encrypted = '';
      cipher.setEncoding('hex');

      cipher.on('data', (chunk) => encrypted += chunk);
      cipher.on('end', () => console.log(encrypted));

      cipher.write('some clear text data');
      cipher.end();
    });
  });
  ```

  Example: Using `Cipheriv` and piped streams:

  ```
  import {
    createReadStream,
    createWriteStream,
  } from 'node:fs';

  import {
    pipeline,
  } from 'node:stream';

  const {
    scrypt,
    randomFill,
    createCipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';

  // First, we'll generate the key. The key length is dependent on the algorithm.
  // In this case for aes192, it is 24 bytes (192 bits).
  scrypt(password, 'salt', 24, (err, key) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    // Then, we'll generate a random initialization vector
    randomFill(new Uint8Array(16), (err, iv) => {
      if (err) throw err;

      const cipher = createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

      const input = createReadStream('test.js');
      const output = createWriteStream('test.enc');

      pipeline(input, cipher, output, (err) => {
        if (err) throw err;
      });
    });
  });
  ```

  Example: Using the `cipher.update()` and `cipher.final()` methods:

  ```
  const {
    scrypt,
    randomFill,
    createCipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';

  // First, we'll generate the key. The key length is dependent on the algorithm.
  // In this case for aes192, it is 24 bytes (192 bits).
  scrypt(password, 'salt', 24, (err, key) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    // Then, we'll generate a random initialization vector
    randomFill(new Uint8Array(16), (err, iv) => {
      if (err) throw err;

      const cipher = createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

      let encrypted = cipher.update('some clear text data', 'utf8', 'hex');
      encrypted += cipher.final('hex');
      console.log(encrypted);
    });
  });
  ```

  + [allowHalfOpen](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/allowHalfOpen): boolean

    If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`.

    This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing `Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
  + readonly [closed](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/closed): boolean

    Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
  + [destroyed](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/destroyed): boolean

    Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
  + readonly [errored](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/errored): null | [Error](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Error)

    Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
  + [readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/readable): boolean

    Is `true` if it is safe to call read, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
  + readonly [readableAborted](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/readableAborted): boolean

    Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
  + readonly [readableDidRead](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/readableDidRead): boolean

    Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
  + readonly [readableEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/readableEncoding): null | BufferEncoding

    Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding` property can be set using the setEncoding method.
  + readonly [readableEnded](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/readableEnded): boolean

    Becomes `true` when [`'end'`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v24.x/api/stream.html#event-end) event is emitted.
  + readonly [readableFlowing](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/readableFlowing): null | boolean

    This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the [Three states](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v24.x/api/stream.html#three-states) section.
  + readonly [readableHighWaterMark](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/readableHighWaterMark): number

    Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
  + readonly [readableLength](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/readableLength): number

    This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
  + readonly [readableObjectMode](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/readableObjectMode): boolean

    Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
  + readonly [writable](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/writable): boolean

    Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
  + readonly [writableAborted](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/writableAborted): boolean

    Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'finish'`.
  + readonly [writableCorked](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/writableCorked): number

    Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
  + readonly [writableEnded](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/writableEnded): boolean

    Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
  + readonly [writableFinished](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/writableFinished): boolean

    Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
  + readonly [writableHighWaterMark](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/writableHighWaterMark): number

    Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
  + readonly [writableLength](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/writableLength): number

    This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
  + readonly [writableNeedDrain](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/writableNeedDrain): boolean

    Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
  + readonly [writableObjectMode](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/writableObjectMode): boolean

    Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
  + static [captureRejections](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/captureRejections): boolean

    Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type)

    Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
  + readonly static [captureRejectionSymbol](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/captureRejectionSymbol): typeof [captureRejectionSymbol](https://bun.com/reference/node/events/default/captureRejectionSymbol)

    Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')`

    See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
  + static [defaultMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/defaultMaxListeners): number

    By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for *all*`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners` property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError` is thrown.

    Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects *all* `EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`.

    This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single `EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()` methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning:

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const emitter = new EventEmitter();
    emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1);
    emitter.once('event', () => {
      // do stuff
      emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0));
    });
    ```

    The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings.

    The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
  + readonly static [errorMonitor](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/errorMonitor): typeof [errorMonitor](https://bun.com/reference/node/events/default/errorMonitor)

    This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'` events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular `'error'` listeners are called.

    Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an `'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.

    This method returns a new stream with chunks of the underlying stream paired with a counter in the form `[index, chunk]`. The first index value is `0` and it increases by 1 for each chunk produced.

    @returns

    a stream of indexed pairs.

    ): T;
  + [cork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/cork)(): void;

    The `writable.cork()` method forces all written data to be buffered in memory. The buffered data will be flushed when either the uncork or end methods are called.

    The primary intent of `writable.cork()` is to accommodate a situation in which several small chunks are written to the stream in rapid succession. Instead of immediately forwarding them to the underlying destination, `writable.cork()` buffers all the chunks until `writable.uncork()` is called, which will pass them all to `writable._writev()`, if present. This prevents a head-of-line blocking situation where data is being buffered while waiting for the first small chunk to be processed. However, use of `writable.cork()` without implementing `writable._writev()` may have an adverse effect on throughput.

    See also: `writable.uncork()`, `writable._writev()`.
  + [destroy](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/destroy)(

    error?: [Error](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Error)

    ): this;

    Destroy the stream. Optionally emit an `'error'` event, and emit a `'close'` event (unless `emitClose` is set to `false`). After this call, the readable stream will release any internal resources and subsequent calls to `push()` will be ignored.

    Once `destroy()` has been called any further calls will be a no-op and no further errors except from `_destroy()` may be emitted as `'error'`.

    Implementors should not override this method, but instead implement `readable._destroy()`.

    @param error

    Error which will be passed as payload in `'error'` event

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<boolean>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.every` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream to check if all awaited return values are truthy value for *fn*. Once an *fn* call on a chunk `await`ed return value is falsy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with `false`. If all of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a truthy value, the promise is fulfilled with `true`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method allows filtering the stream. For each chunk in the stream the *fn* function will be called and if it returns a truthy value, the chunk will be passed to the result stream. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed.

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.find` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream to find a chunk with a truthy value for *fn*. Once an *fn* call's awaited return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with value for which *fn* returned a truthy value. If all of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a falsy value, the promise is fulfilled with `undefined`.

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.find` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream to find a chunk with a truthy value for *fn*. Once an *fn* call's awaited return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with value for which *fn* returned a truthy value. If all of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a falsy value, the promise is fulfilled with `undefined`.

    @param fn

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method returns a new stream by applying the given callback to each chunk of the stream and then flattening the result.

    It is possible to return a stream or another iterable or async iterable from *fn* and the result streams will be merged (flattened) into the returned stream.

    @param fn

    a function to map over every chunk in the stream. May be async. May be a stream or generator.

    @returns

    a stream flat-mapped with the function *fn*.

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<void>;

    This method allows iterating a stream. For each chunk in the stream the *fn* function will be called. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed.

    This method is different from `for await...of` loops in that it can optionally process chunks concurrently. In addition, a `forEach` iteration can only be stopped by having passed a `signal` option and aborting the related AbortController while `for await...of` can be stopped with `break` or `return`. In either case the stream will be destroyed.

    This method is different from listening to the `'data'` event in that it uses the `readable` event in the underlying machinary and can limit the number of concurrent *fn* calls.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise for when the stream has finished.
  + [getMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/getMaxListeners)(): number;

    Returns the current max listener value for the `EventEmitter` which is either set by `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` or defaults to EventEmitter.defaultMaxListeners.
  + [isPaused](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/isPaused)(): boolean;

    The `readable.isPaused()` method returns the current operating state of the `Readable`. This is used primarily by the mechanism that underlies the `readable.pipe()` method. In most typical cases, there will be no reason to use this method directly.

    ```
    const readable = new stream.Readable();

    readable.isPaused(); // === false
    readable.pause();
    readable.isPaused(); // === true
    readable.resume();
    readable.isPaused(); // === false
    ```
  + [iterator](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/iterator)(

    options?: { destroyOnReturn: boolean }

    ): AsyncIterator<any>;

    The iterator created by this method gives users the option to cancel the destruction of the stream if the `for await...of` loop is exited by `return`, `break`, or `throw`, or if the iterator should destroy the stream if the stream emitted an error during iteration.
  + [listenerCount](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/listenerCount)<K>(

    eventName: string | symbol,

    listener?: Function

    Returns the number of listeners listening for the event named `eventName`. If `listener` is provided, it will return how many times the listener is found in the list of the listeners of the event.

    @param eventName

    The name of the event being listened for

    @param listener

    The event handler function
  + [listeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/listeners)<K>(

    eventName: string | symbol

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method allows mapping over the stream. The *fn* function will be called for every chunk in the stream. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed before being passed to the result stream.

    @param fn

    a function to map over every chunk in the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a stream mapped with the function *fn*.
  + [off](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/off)<K>(

    Alias for `emitter.removeListener()`.
  + [on](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/on)(

    event: 'close',

    listener: () => void

    ): this;

    Adds the `listener` function to the end of the listeners array for the event named `eventName`. No checks are made to see if the `listener` has already been added. Multiple calls passing the same combination of `eventName` and `listener` will result in the `listener` being added, and called, multiple times.

    ```
    server.on('connection', (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    });
    ```

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

    By default, event listeners are invoked in the order they are added. The `emitter.prependListener()` method can be used as an alternative to add the event listener to the beginning of the listeners array.

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const myEE = new EventEmitter();
    myEE.on('foo', () => console.log('a'));
    myEE.prependListener('foo', () => console.log('b'));

    ```
  + [read](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/read)(

    size?: number

    ): any;

    The `readable.read()` method reads data out of the internal buffer and returns it. If no data is available to be read, `null` is returned. By default, the data is returned as a `Buffer` object unless an encoding has been specified using the `readable.setEncoding()` method or the stream is operating in object mode.

    The optional `size` argument specifies a specific number of bytes to read. If `size` bytes are not available to be read, `null` will be returned *unless* the stream has ended, in which case all of the data remaining in the internal buffer will be returned.

    If the `size` argument is not specified, all of the data contained in the internal buffer will be returned.

    The `size` argument must be less than or equal to 1 GiB.

    The `readable.read()` method should only be called on `Readable` streams operating in paused mode. In flowing mode, `readable.read()` is called automatically until the internal buffer is fully drained.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();

    // 'readable' may be triggered multiple times as data is buffered in
    readable.on('readable', () => {
      let chunk;
      console.log('Stream is readable (new data received in buffer)');
      // Use a loop to make sure we read all currently available data
      while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
        console.log(`Read ${chunk.length} bytes of data...`);
      }
    });

    // 'end' will be triggered once when there is no more data available
    readable.on('end', () => {
      console.log('Reached end of stream.');
    });
    ```

    Each call to `readable.read()` returns a chunk of data, or `null`. The chunks are not concatenated. A `while` loop is necessary to consume all data currently in the buffer. When reading a large file `.read()` may return `null`, having consumed all buffered content so far, but there is still more data to come not yet buffered. In this case a new `'readable'` event will be emitted when there is more data in the buffer. Finally the `'end'` event will be emitted when there is no more data to come.

    Therefore to read a file's whole contents from a `readable`, it is necessary to collect chunks across multiple `'readable'` events:

    ```
    const chunks = [];

    readable.on('readable', () => {
      let chunk;
      while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
        chunks.push(chunk);
      }
    });

    readable.on('end', () => {
      const content = chunks.join('');
    });
    ```

    A `Readable` stream in object mode will always return a single item from a call to `readable.read(size)`, regardless of the value of the `size` argument.

    If the `readable.read()` method returns a chunk of data, a `'data'` event will also be emitted.

    Calling read after the `'end'` event has been emitted will return `null`. No runtime error will be raised.

    Optional argument to specify how much data to read.

    This method calls *fn* on each chunk of the stream in order, passing it the result from the calculation on the previous element. It returns a promise for the final value of the reduction.

    If no *initial* value is supplied the first chunk of the stream is used as the initial value. If the stream is empty, the promise is rejected with a `TypeError` with the `ERR_INVALID_ARGS` code property.

    The reducer function iterates the stream element-by-element which means that there is no *concurrency* parameter or parallelism. To perform a reduce concurrently, you can extract the async function to `readable.map` method.

    @param fn

    a reducer function to call over every chunk in the stream. Async or not.

    @param initial

    the initial value to use in the reduction.

  + [removeAllListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/removeAllListeners)(

    eventName?: string | symbol

    ): this;

    Removes all listeners, or those of the specified `eventName`.

    It is bad practice to remove listeners added elsewhere in the code, particularly when the `EventEmitter` instance was created by some other component or module (e.g. sockets or file streams).

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [removeListener](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/removeListener)(

    event: 'close',

    listener: () => void

    ): this;

    Removes the specified `listener` from the listener array for the event named `eventName`.

    ```
    const callback = (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    };
    server.on('connection', callback);
    // ...
    server.removeListener('connection', callback);
    ```

    `removeListener()` will remove, at most, one instance of a listener from the listener array. If any single listener has been added multiple times to the listener array for the specified `eventName`, then `removeListener()` must be called multiple times to remove each instance.

    Once an event is emitted, all listeners attached to it at the time of emitting are called in order. This implies that any `removeListener()` or `removeAllListeners()` calls *after* emitting and *before* the last listener finishes execution will not remove them from`emit()` in progress. Subsequent events behave as expected.

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}
    const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

    const callbackA = () => {
      console.log('A');
      myEmitter.removeListener('event', callbackB);
    };

    const callbackB = () => {
      console.log('B');
    };

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackA);

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackB);

    // callbackA removes listener callbackB but it will still be called.
    // Internal listener array at time of emit [callbackA, callbackB]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    //   B

    // callbackB is now removed.
    // Internal listener array [callbackA]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    ```

    Because listeners are managed using an internal array, calling this will change the position indices of any listener registered *after* the listener being removed. This will not impact the order in which listeners are called, but it means that any copies of the listener array as returned by the `emitter.listeners()` method will need to be recreated.

    When a single function has been added as a handler multiple times for a single event (as in the example below), `removeListener()` will remove the most recently added instance. In the example the `once('ping')` listener is removed:

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const ee = new EventEmitter();

    function pong() {
      console.log('pong');
    }

    ee.on('ping', pong);
    ee.once('ping', pong);
    ee.removeListener('ping', pong);

    ee.emit('ping');
    ee.emit('ping');
    ```

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

    The `readable.resume()` method causes an explicitly paused `Readable` stream to resume emitting `'data'` events, switching the stream into flowing mode.

    The `readable.resume()` method can be used to fully consume the data from a stream without actually processing any of that data:

    ```
    getReadableStreamSomehow()
      .resume()
      .on('end', () => {
        console.log('Reached the end, but did not read anything.');
      });

  + [setAutoPadding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/setAutoPadding)(

    autoPadding?: boolean

    ): this;

    When using block encryption algorithms, the `Cipheriv` class will automatically add padding to the input data to the appropriate block size. To disable the default padding call `cipher.setAutoPadding(false)`.

    When `autoPadding` is `false`, the length of the entire input data must be a multiple of the cipher's block size or `cipher.final()` will throw an error. Disabling automatic padding is useful for non-standard padding, for instance using `0x0` instead of PKCS padding.

    The `cipher.setAutoPadding()` method must be called before `cipher.final()`.

    @returns

    for method chaining.
  + [setDefaultEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/setDefaultEncoding)(

    encoding: BufferEncoding

    ): this;

    The `writable.setDefaultEncoding()` method sets the default `encoding` for a `Writable` stream.

    @param encoding

    The new default encoding
  + [setEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/setEncoding)(

    encoding: BufferEncoding

    ): this;

    The `readable.setEncoding()` method sets the character encoding for data read from the `Readable` stream.

    By default, no encoding is assigned and stream data will be returned as `Buffer` objects. Setting an encoding causes the stream data to be returned as strings of the specified encoding rather than as `Buffer` objects. For instance, calling `readable.setEncoding('utf8')` will cause the output data to be interpreted as UTF-8 data, and passed as strings. Calling `readable.setEncoding('hex')` will cause the data to be encoded in hexadecimal string format.

    The `Readable` stream will properly handle multi-byte characters delivered through the stream that would otherwise become improperly decoded if simply pulled from the stream as `Buffer` objects.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
    readable.setEncoding('utf8');
    readable.on('data', (chunk) => {
      assert.equal(typeof chunk, 'string');
      console.log('Got %d characters of string data:', chunk.length);
    });
    ```

    @param encoding

    The encoding to use.
  + [setMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/setMaxListeners)(

    n: number

    ): this;

    By default `EventEmitter`s will print a warning if more than `10` listeners are added for a particular event. This is a useful default that helps finding memory leaks. The `emitter.setMaxListeners()` method allows the limit to be modified for this specific `EventEmitter` instance. The value can be set to `Infinity` (or `0`) to indicate an unlimited number of listeners.

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [some](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/some)(

    fn: (data: any, options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>) => boolean | Promise<boolean>,

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<boolean>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.some` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream until the awaited return value is `true` (or any truthy value). Once an *fn* call on a chunk `await`ed return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with `true`. If none of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a truthy value, the promise is fulfilled with `false`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise evaluating to `true` if *fn* returned a truthy value for at least one of the chunks.
  + [take](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/take)(

    limit: number,

    options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>

    This method returns a new stream with the first *limit* chunks.

    @param limit

    the number of chunks to take from the readable.

    @returns

    a stream with *limit* chunks taken.
  + [toArray](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/toArray)(

    options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>

    ): Promise<any[]>;

    This method allows easily obtaining the contents of a stream.

    As this method reads the entire stream into memory, it negates the benefits of streams. It's intended for interoperability and convenience, not as the primary way to consume streams.

    @returns

    a promise containing an array with the contents of the stream.
  + [uncork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/uncork)(): void;

    The `writable.uncork()` method flushes all data buffered since cork was called.

    When using `writable.cork()` and `writable.uncork()` to manage the buffering of writes to a stream, defer calls to `writable.uncork()` using `process.nextTick()`. Doing so allows batching of all `writable.write()` calls that occur within a given Node.js event loop phase.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => stream.uncork());
    ```

    If the `writable.cork()` method is called multiple times on a stream, the same number of calls to `writable.uncork()` must be called to flush the buffered data.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => {
      stream.uncork();
      // The data will not be flushed until uncork() is called a second time.
      stream.uncork();
    });
    ```

    The `readable.unpipe()` method detaches a `Writable` stream previously attached using the pipe method.

    If the `destination` is not specified, then *all* pipes are detached.

    If the `destination` is specified, but no pipe is set up for it, then the method does nothing.

    ```
    import fs from 'node:fs';
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
    const writable = fs.createWriteStream('file.txt');
    // All the data from readable goes into 'file.txt',
    // but only for the first second.
    readable.pipe(writable);
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Stop writing to file.txt.');
      readable.unpipe(writable);
      console.log('Manually close the file stream.');
      writable.end();
    }, 1000);

  + [unshift](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Cipheriv/unshift)(

    chunk: any,

    encoding?: BufferEncoding

    ): void;

    Passing `chunk` as `null` signals the end of the stream (EOF) and behaves the same as `readable.push(null)`, after which no more data can be written. The EOF signal is put at the end of the buffer and any buffered data will still be flushed.

    The `readable.unshift()` method pushes a chunk of data back into the internal buffer. This is useful in certain situations where a stream is being consumed by code that needs to "un-consume" some amount of data that it has optimistically pulled out of the source, so that the data can be passed on to some other party.

    The `stream.unshift(chunk)` method cannot be called after the `'end'` event has been emitted or a runtime error will be thrown.

    Developers using `stream.unshift()` often should consider switching to use of a `Transform` stream instead. See the `API for stream implementers` section for more information.

    ```
    // Pull off a header delimited by \n\n.
    // Use unshift() if we get too much.
    // Call the callback with (error, header, stream).
    import { StringDecoder } from 'node:string_decoder';
    function parseHeader(stream, callback) {
      stream.on('error', callback);
      stream.on('readable', onReadable);
      const decoder = new StringDecoder('utf8');
      let header = '';
      function onReadable() {
        let chunk;
        while (null !== (chunk = stream.read())) {
          const str = decoder.write(chunk);
          if (str.includes('\n\n')) {
            // Found the header boundary.
            const split = str.split(/\n\n/);
            header += split.shift();
            const remaining = split.join('\n\n');
            const buf = Buffer.from(remaining, 'utf8');
            stream.removeListener('error', callback);
            // Remove the 'readable' listener before unshifting.
            stream.removeListener('readable', onReadable);
            if (buf.length)
              stream.unshift(buf);
            // Now the body of the message can be read from the stream.
            callback(null, header, stream);
            return;
          }
          // Still reading the header.
          header += str;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Unlike push, `stream.unshift(chunk)` will not end the reading process by resetting the internal reading state of the stream. This can cause unexpected results if `readable.unshift()` is called during a read (i.e. from within a \_read implementation on a custom stream). Following the call to `readable.unshift()` with an immediate push will reset the reading state appropriately, however it is best to simply avoid calling `readable.unshift()` while in the process of performing a read.

    @param chunk

    Chunk of data to unshift onto the read queue. For streams not operating in object mode, `chunk` must be a {string}, {Buffer}, {TypedArray}, {DataView} or `null`. For object mode streams, `chunk` may be any JavaScript value.

    stream: ReadableStream

    ): this;

    Prior to Node.js 0.10, streams did not implement the entire `node:stream` module API as it is currently defined. (See `Compatibility` for more information.)

    When using an older Node.js library that emits `'data'` events and has a pause method that is advisory only, the `readable.wrap()` method can be used to create a `Readable` stream that uses the old stream as its data source.

    It will rarely be necessary to use `readable.wrap()` but the method has been provided as a convenience for interacting with older Node.js applications and libraries.

    ```
    import { OldReader } from './old-api-module.js';
    import { Readable } from 'node:stream';
    const oreader = new OldReader();
    const myReader = new Readable().wrap(oreader);

    myReader.on('readable', () => {
      myReader.read(); // etc.
    });

    chunk: any,

    callback?: (error: undefined | null | [Error](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Error)) => void

    ): boolean;

    The `writable.write()` method writes some data to the stream, and calls the supplied `callback` once the data has been fully handled. If an error occurs, the `callback` will be called with the error as its first argument. The `callback` is called asynchronously and before `'error'` is emitted.

    The return value is `true` if the internal buffer is less than the `highWaterMark` configured when the stream was created after admitting `chunk`. If `false` is returned, further attempts to write data to the stream should stop until the `'drain'` event is emitted.

    While a stream is not draining, calls to `write()` will buffer `chunk`, and return false. Once all currently buffered chunks are drained (accepted for delivery by the operating system), the `'drain'` event will be emitted. Once `write()` returns false, do not write more chunks until the `'drain'` event is emitted. While calling `write()` on a stream that is not draining is allowed, Node.js will buffer all written chunks until maximum memory usage occurs, at which point it will abort unconditionally. Even before it aborts, high memory usage will cause poor garbage collector performance and high RSS (which is not typically released back to the system, even after the memory is no longer required). Since TCP sockets may never drain if the remote peer does not read the data, writing a socket that is not draining may lead to a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

    Writing data while the stream is not draining is particularly problematic for a `Transform`, because the `Transform` streams are paused by default until they are piped or a `'data'` or `'readable'` event handler is added.

    If the data to be written can be generated or fetched on demand, it is recommended to encapsulate the logic into a `Readable` and use pipe. However, if calling `write()` is preferred, it is possible to respect backpressure and avoid memory issues using the `'drain'` event:

    ```
    function write(data, cb) {
      if (!stream.write(data)) {
        stream.once('drain', cb);
      } else {
        process.nextTick(cb);
      }
    }

    // Wait for cb to be called before doing any other write.
    write('hello', () => {
      console.log('Write completed, do more writes now.');

    ): Disposable;

    Listens once to the `abort` event on the provided `signal`.

    Listening to the `abort` event on abort signals is unsafe and may lead to resource leaks since another third party with the signal can call `e.stopImmediatePropagation()`. Unfortunately Node.js cannot change this since it would violate the web standard. Additionally, the original API makes it easy to forget to remove listeners.

    This API allows safely using `AbortSignal`s in Node.js APIs by solving these two issues by listening to the event such that `stopImmediatePropagation` does not prevent the listener from running.

    Returns a disposable so that it may be unsubscribed from more easily.

    ```
    import { addAbortListener } from 'node:events';

    function example(signal) {

    import { on, EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    import process from 'node:process';

    const ee = new EventEmitter();

    // Emit later on
    process.nextTick(() => {
      ee.emit('foo', 'bar');
      ee.emit('foo', 42);
      ee.emit('close');
    });

    for await (const event of on(ee, 'foo', { close: ['close'] })) {
      console.log(event); // prints ['bar'] [42]
    }
    // the loop will exit after 'close' is emitted
    console.log('done'); // prints 'done'
    ```

    Creates a `Promise` that is fulfilled when the `EventEmitter` emits the given event or that is rejected if the `EventEmitter` emits `'error'` while waiting. The `Promise` will resolve with an array of all the arguments emitted to the given event.

    This method is intentionally generic and works with the web platform [EventTarget](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-eventtarget) interface, which has no special`'error'` event semantics and does not listen to the `'error'` event.

    ```
    import { once, EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    import process from 'node:process';

    const ee = new EventEmitter();

    process.nextTick(() => {
      ee.emit('myevent', 42);
    });

    try {
      await once(ee, 'myevent');
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('error happened', err);
    }
    ```

    The special handling of the `'error'` event is only used when `events.once()` is used to wait for another event. If `events.once()` is used to wait for the '`error'` event itself, then it is treated as any other kind of event without special handling:

    ```
    import { EventEmitter, once } from 'node:events';

    const ee = new EventEmitter();

    once(ee, 'error')
      .then(([err]) => console.log('ok', err.message))
      .catch((err) => console.error('error', err.message));

    ee.emit('error', new Error('boom'));

    // Prints: ok boom
    ```

    An `AbortSignal` can be used to cancel waiting for the event:

    ```
    import { EventEmitter, once } from 'node:events';

    const ee = new EventEmitter();
    const ac = new AbortController();

    async function foo(emitter, event, signal) {

    ): { readable: [ReadableStream](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/web/ReadableStream); writable: [WritableStream](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/web/WritableStream) };

    A utility method for creating a web `ReadableStream` and `WritableStream` from a `Duplex`.
* ### class [Decipheriv](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv)

  Instances of the `Decipheriv` class are used to decrypt data. The class can be used in one of two ways:

  + As a `stream` that is both readable and writable, where plain encrypted data is written to produce unencrypted data on the readable side, or
  + Using the `decipher.update()` and `decipher.final()` methods to produce the unencrypted data.

  The createDecipheriv method is used to create `Decipheriv` instances. `Decipheriv` objects are not to be created directly using the `new` keyword.

  Example: Using `Decipheriv` objects as streams:

  ```
  import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';
  const {
    scryptSync,
    createDecipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';
  // Key length is dependent on the algorithm. In this case for aes192, it is
  // 24 bytes (192 bits).
  // Use the async `crypto.scrypt()` instead.
  const key = scryptSync(password, 'salt', 24);
  // The IV is usually passed along with the ciphertext.
  const iv = Buffer.alloc(16, 0); // Initialization vector.

  const decipher = createDecipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

  let decrypted = '';
  decipher.on('readable', () => {
    let chunk;
    while (null !== (chunk = decipher.read())) {
      decrypted += chunk.toString('utf8');
    }
  });
  decipher.on('end', () => {
    console.log(decrypted);
    // Prints: some clear text data
  });

  // Encrypted with same algorithm, key and iv.
  const encrypted =
    'e5f79c5915c02171eec6b212d5520d44480993d7d622a7c4c2da32f6efda0ffa';
  decipher.write(encrypted, 'hex');
  decipher.end();
  ```

  Example: Using `Decipheriv` and piped streams:

  ```
  import {
    createReadStream,
    createWriteStream,
  } from 'node:fs';
  import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';
  const {
    scryptSync,
    createDecipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';
  // Use the async `crypto.scrypt()` instead.
  const key = scryptSync(password, 'salt', 24);
  // The IV is usually passed along with the ciphertext.
  const iv = Buffer.alloc(16, 0); // Initialization vector.

  const decipher = createDecipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

  const input = createReadStream('test.enc');
  const output = createWriteStream('test.js');

  input.pipe(decipher).pipe(output);
  ```

  Example: Using the `decipher.update()` and `decipher.final()` methods:

  ```
  import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';
  const {
    scryptSync,
    createDecipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';
  // Use the async `crypto.scrypt()` instead.
  const key = scryptSync(password, 'salt', 24);
  // The IV is usually passed along with the ciphertext.
  const iv = Buffer.alloc(16, 0); // Initialization vector.

  const decipher = createDecipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

  // Encrypted using same algorithm, key and iv.
  const encrypted =
    'e5f79c5915c02171eec6b212d5520d44480993d7d622a7c4c2da32f6efda0ffa';
  let decrypted = decipher.update(encrypted, 'hex', 'utf8');
  decrypted += decipher.final('utf8');
  console.log(decrypted);
  // Prints: some clear text data
  ```

  + [allowHalfOpen](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/allowHalfOpen): boolean

    If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`.

    This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing `Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
  + readonly [closed](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/closed): boolean

    Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
  + [destroyed](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/destroyed): boolean

    Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
  + readonly [errored](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/errored): null | [Error](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Error)

    Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
  + [readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/readable): boolean

    Is `true` if it is safe to call read, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
  + readonly [readableAborted](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/readableAborted): boolean

    Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
  + readonly [readableDidRead](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/readableDidRead): boolean

    Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
  + readonly [readableEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/readableEncoding): null | BufferEncoding

    Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding` property can be set using the setEncoding method.
  + readonly [readableEnded](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/readableEnded): boolean

  + readonly [readableFlowing](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/readableFlowing): null | boolean

    This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the [Three states](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v24.x/api/stream.html#three-states) section.
  + readonly [readableHighWaterMark](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/readableHighWaterMark): number

    Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
  + readonly [readableLength](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/readableLength): number

    This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
  + readonly [readableObjectMode](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/readableObjectMode): boolean

    Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
  + readonly [writable](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/writable): boolean

    Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
  + readonly [writableAborted](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/writableAborted): boolean

    Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'finish'`.
  + readonly [writableCorked](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/writableCorked): number

    Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
  + readonly [writableEnded](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/writableEnded): boolean

    Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
  + readonly [writableFinished](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/writableFinished): boolean

    Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
  + readonly [writableHighWaterMark](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/writableHighWaterMark): number

    Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
  + readonly [writableLength](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/writableLength): number

    This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
  + readonly [writableNeedDrain](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/writableNeedDrain): boolean

    Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
  + readonly [writableObjectMode](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/writableObjectMode): boolean

    Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
  + static [captureRejections](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/captureRejections): boolean

    Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type)

    Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
  + readonly static [captureRejectionSymbol](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/captureRejectionSymbol): typeof [captureRejectionSymbol](https://bun.com/reference/node/events/default/captureRejectionSymbol)

    Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')`

    See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
  + static [defaultMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/defaultMaxListeners): number

    By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for *all*`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners` property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError` is thrown.

    Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects *all* `EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`.

    This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single `EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()` methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning:

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const emitter = new EventEmitter();
    emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1);
    emitter.once('event', () => {
      // do stuff
      emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0));
    });
    ```

    The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings.

    The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
  + readonly static [errorMonitor](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/errorMonitor): typeof [errorMonitor](https://bun.com/reference/node/events/default/errorMonitor)

    This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'` events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular `'error'` listeners are called.

    Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an `'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.

    This method returns a new stream with chunks of the underlying stream paired with a counter in the form `[index, chunk]`. The first index value is `0` and it increases by 1 for each chunk produced.

    ): T;
  + [cork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/cork)(): void;

    The `writable.cork()` method forces all written data to be buffered in memory. The buffered data will be flushed when either the uncork or end methods are called.

    The primary intent of `writable.cork()` is to accommodate a situation in which several small chunks are written to the stream in rapid succession. Instead of immediately forwarding them to the underlying destination, `writable.cork()` buffers all the chunks until `writable.uncork()` is called, which will pass them all to `writable._writev()`, if present. This prevents a head-of-line blocking situation where data is being buffered while waiting for the first small chunk to be processed. However, use of `writable.cork()` without implementing `writable._writev()` may have an adverse effect on throughput.

    See also: `writable.uncork()`, `writable._writev()`.
  + [destroy](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/destroy)(

    error?: [Error](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Error)

    ): this;

    Destroy the stream. Optionally emit an `'error'` event, and emit a `'close'` event (unless `emitClose` is set to `false`). After this call, the readable stream will release any internal resources and subsequent calls to `push()` will be ignored.

    Once `destroy()` has been called any further calls will be a no-op and no further errors except from `_destroy()` may be emitted as `'error'`.

    Implementors should not override this method, but instead implement `readable._destroy()`.

    @param error

    Error which will be passed as payload in `'error'` event

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<boolean>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.every` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream to check if all awaited return values are truthy value for *fn*. Once an *fn* call on a chunk `await`ed return value is falsy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with `false`. If all of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a truthy value, the promise is fulfilled with `true`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.find` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream to find a chunk with a truthy value for *fn*. Once an *fn* call's awaited return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with value for which *fn* returned a truthy value. If all of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a falsy value, the promise is fulfilled with `undefined`.

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method returns a new stream by applying the given callback to each chunk of the stream and then flattening the result.

    It is possible to return a stream or another iterable or async iterable from *fn* and the result streams will be merged (flattened) into the returned stream.

    @param fn

    a function to map over every chunk in the stream. May be async. May be a stream or generator.

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<void>;

    This method allows iterating a stream. For each chunk in the stream the *fn* function will be called. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed.

    This method is different from `for await...of` loops in that it can optionally process chunks concurrently. In addition, a `forEach` iteration can only be stopped by having passed a `signal` option and aborting the related AbortController while `for await...of` can be stopped with `break` or `return`. In either case the stream will be destroyed.

    This method is different from listening to the `'data'` event in that it uses the `readable` event in the underlying machinary and can limit the number of concurrent *fn* calls.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise for when the stream has finished.

    Returns the current max listener value for the `EventEmitter` which is either set by `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` or defaults to EventEmitter.defaultMaxListeners.
  + [isPaused](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/isPaused)(): boolean;

    The `readable.isPaused()` method returns the current operating state of the `Readable`. This is used primarily by the mechanism that underlies the `readable.pipe()` method. In most typical cases, there will be no reason to use this method directly.

    ```
    const readable = new stream.Readable();

    readable.isPaused(); // === false
    readable.pause();
    readable.isPaused(); // === true
    readable.resume();
    readable.isPaused(); // === false
    ```
  + [iterator](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/iterator)(

    options?: { destroyOnReturn: boolean }

    ): AsyncIterator<any>;

    The iterator created by this method gives users the option to cancel the destruction of the stream if the `for await...of` loop is exited by `return`, `break`, or `throw`, or if the iterator should destroy the stream if the stream emitted an error during iteration.
  + [listenerCount](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/listenerCount)<K>(

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method allows mapping over the stream. The *fn* function will be called for every chunk in the stream. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed before being passed to the result stream.

    @param fn

    a function to map over every chunk in the stream. Async or not.

  + [on](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/on)(

    event: 'close',

    listener: () => void

    ): this;

    Adds the `listener` function to the end of the listeners array for the event named `eventName`. No checks are made to see if the `listener` has already been added. Multiple calls passing the same combination of `eventName` and `listener` will result in the `listener` being added, and called, multiple times.

    ```
    server.on('connection', (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    });
    ```

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

    By default, event listeners are invoked in the order they are added. The `emitter.prependListener()` method can be used as an alternative to add the event listener to the beginning of the listeners array.

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const myEE = new EventEmitter();
    myEE.on('foo', () => console.log('a'));

    ```
  + [read](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/read)(

    size?: number

    ): any;

    The `readable.read()` method reads data out of the internal buffer and returns it. If no data is available to be read, `null` is returned. By default, the data is returned as a `Buffer` object unless an encoding has been specified using the `readable.setEncoding()` method or the stream is operating in object mode.

    The optional `size` argument specifies a specific number of bytes to read. If `size` bytes are not available to be read, `null` will be returned *unless* the stream has ended, in which case all of the data remaining in the internal buffer will be returned.

    If the `size` argument is not specified, all of the data contained in the internal buffer will be returned.

    The `size` argument must be less than or equal to 1 GiB.

    The `readable.read()` method should only be called on `Readable` streams operating in paused mode. In flowing mode, `readable.read()` is called automatically until the internal buffer is fully drained.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();

    // 'readable' may be triggered multiple times as data is buffered in
    readable.on('readable', () => {
      let chunk;
      console.log('Stream is readable (new data received in buffer)');
      // Use a loop to make sure we read all currently available data
      while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
        console.log(`Read ${chunk.length} bytes of data...`);
      }
    });

    // 'end' will be triggered once when there is no more data available
    readable.on('end', () => {
      console.log('Reached end of stream.');
    });
    ```

    Each call to `readable.read()` returns a chunk of data, or `null`. The chunks are not concatenated. A `while` loop is necessary to consume all data currently in the buffer. When reading a large file `.read()` may return `null`, having consumed all buffered content so far, but there is still more data to come not yet buffered. In this case a new `'readable'` event will be emitted when there is more data in the buffer. Finally the `'end'` event will be emitted when there is no more data to come.

    Therefore to read a file's whole contents from a `readable`, it is necessary to collect chunks across multiple `'readable'` events:

    ```
    const chunks = [];

    readable.on('readable', () => {
      let chunk;
      while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
        chunks.push(chunk);
      }
    });

    readable.on('end', () => {
      const content = chunks.join('');
    });
    ```

    A `Readable` stream in object mode will always return a single item from a call to `readable.read(size)`, regardless of the value of the `size` argument.

    If the `readable.read()` method returns a chunk of data, a `'data'` event will also be emitted.

    Calling read after the `'end'` event has been emitted will return `null`. No runtime error will be raised.

    @param size

    Optional argument to specify how much data to read.

    This method calls *fn* on each chunk of the stream in order, passing it the result from the calculation on the previous element. It returns a promise for the final value of the reduction.

    If no *initial* value is supplied the first chunk of the stream is used as the initial value. If the stream is empty, the promise is rejected with a `TypeError` with the `ERR_INVALID_ARGS` code property.

    The reducer function iterates the stream element-by-element which means that there is no *concurrency* parameter or parallelism. To perform a reduce concurrently, you can extract the async function to `readable.map` method.

  + [removeAllListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/removeAllListeners)(

    eventName?: string | symbol

    ): this;

    Removes all listeners, or those of the specified `eventName`.

    It is bad practice to remove listeners added elsewhere in the code, particularly when the `EventEmitter` instance was created by some other component or module (e.g. sockets or file streams).

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [removeListener](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/removeListener)(

    event: 'close',

    listener: () => void

    ): this;

    Removes the specified `listener` from the listener array for the event named `eventName`.

    ```
    const callback = (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    };
    server.on('connection', callback);
    // ...
    server.removeListener('connection', callback);
    ```

    `removeListener()` will remove, at most, one instance of a listener from the listener array. If any single listener has been added multiple times to the listener array for the specified `eventName`, then `removeListener()` must be called multiple times to remove each instance.

    Once an event is emitted, all listeners attached to it at the time of emitting are called in order. This implies that any `removeListener()` or `removeAllListeners()` calls *after* emitting and *before* the last listener finishes execution will not remove them from`emit()` in progress. Subsequent events behave as expected.

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}
    const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

    const callbackA = () => {
      console.log('A');
      myEmitter.removeListener('event', callbackB);
    };

    const callbackB = () => {
      console.log('B');
    };

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackA);

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackB);

    // callbackA removes listener callbackB but it will still be called.
    // Internal listener array at time of emit [callbackA, callbackB]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    //   B

    // callbackB is now removed.
    // Internal listener array [callbackA]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    ```

    Because listeners are managed using an internal array, calling this will change the position indices of any listener registered *after* the listener being removed. This will not impact the order in which listeners are called, but it means that any copies of the listener array as returned by the `emitter.listeners()` method will need to be recreated.

    When a single function has been added as a handler multiple times for a single event (as in the example below), `removeListener()` will remove the most recently added instance. In the example the `once('ping')` listener is removed:

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const ee = new EventEmitter();

    function pong() {
      console.log('pong');
    }

    ee.on('ping', pong);
    ee.once('ping', pong);
    ee.removeListener('ping', pong);

    ee.emit('ping');
    ee.emit('ping');
    ```

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

    The `readable.resume()` method causes an explicitly paused `Readable` stream to resume emitting `'data'` events, switching the stream into flowing mode.

    The `readable.resume()` method can be used to fully consume the data from a stream without actually processing any of that data:

    ```
    getReadableStreamSomehow()
      .resume()
      .on('end', () => {
        console.log('Reached the end, but did not read anything.');

    auto\_padding?: boolean

    When data has been encrypted without standard block padding, calling `decipher.setAutoPadding(false)` will disable automatic padding to prevent `decipher.final()` from checking for and removing padding.

    Turning auto padding off will only work if the input data's length is a multiple of the ciphers block size.

    The `decipher.setAutoPadding()` method must be called before `decipher.final()`.

    for method chaining.
  + [setDefaultEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/setDefaultEncoding)(

    The `writable.setDefaultEncoding()` method sets the default `encoding` for a `Writable` stream.

    @param encoding

    The new default encoding
  + [setEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/setEncoding)(

    encoding: BufferEncoding

    ): this;

    The `readable.setEncoding()` method sets the character encoding for data read from the `Readable` stream.

    By default, no encoding is assigned and stream data will be returned as `Buffer` objects. Setting an encoding causes the stream data to be returned as strings of the specified encoding rather than as `Buffer` objects. For instance, calling `readable.setEncoding('utf8')` will cause the output data to be interpreted as UTF-8 data, and passed as strings. Calling `readable.setEncoding('hex')` will cause the data to be encoded in hexadecimal string format.

    The `Readable` stream will properly handle multi-byte characters delivered through the stream that would otherwise become improperly decoded if simply pulled from the stream as `Buffer` objects.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
    readable.setEncoding('utf8');
    readable.on('data', (chunk) => {
      assert.equal(typeof chunk, 'string');
      console.log('Got %d characters of string data:', chunk.length);
    });

    The encoding to use.
  + [setMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/setMaxListeners)(

    n: number

    ): this;

    By default `EventEmitter`s will print a warning if more than `10` listeners are added for a particular event. This is a useful default that helps finding memory leaks. The `emitter.setMaxListeners()` method allows the limit to be modified for this specific `EventEmitter` instance. The value can be set to `Infinity` (or `0`) to indicate an unlimited number of listeners.

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [some](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/some)(

    fn: (data: any, options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>) => boolean | Promise<boolean>,

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<boolean>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.some` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream until the awaited return value is `true` (or any truthy value). Once an *fn* call on a chunk `await`ed return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with `true`. If none of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a truthy value, the promise is fulfilled with `false`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise evaluating to `true` if *fn* returned a truthy value for at least one of the chunks.

    options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>

    This method returns a new stream with the first *limit* chunks.

    @param limit

    the number of chunks to take from the readable.

    @returns

    a stream with *limit* chunks taken.
  + [toArray](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/toArray)(

    options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>

    ): Promise<any[]>;

    This method allows easily obtaining the contents of a stream.

    As this method reads the entire stream into memory, it negates the benefits of streams. It's intended for interoperability and convenience, not as the primary way to consume streams.

    @returns

    a promise containing an array with the contents of the stream.
  + [uncork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/uncork)(): void;

    The `writable.uncork()` method flushes all data buffered since cork was called.

    When using `writable.cork()` and `writable.uncork()` to manage the buffering of writes to a stream, defer calls to `writable.uncork()` using `process.nextTick()`. Doing so allows batching of all `writable.write()` calls that occur within a given Node.js event loop phase.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => stream.uncork());
    ```

    If the `writable.cork()` method is called multiple times on a stream, the same number of calls to `writable.uncork()` must be called to flush the buffered data.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => {
      stream.uncork();
      // The data will not be flushed until uncork() is called a second time.
      stream.uncork();
    });
    ```

    See also: `writable.cork()`.
  + [unpipe](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/unpipe)(

    destination?: WritableStream

    ): this;

    The `readable.unpipe()` method detaches a `Writable` stream previously attached using the pipe method.

    If the `destination` is not specified, then *all* pipes are detached.

      console.log('Stop writing to file.txt.');
      readable.unpipe(writable);

    Optional specific stream to unpipe
  + [unshift](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/unshift)(

    chunk: any,

    encoding?: BufferEncoding

    ): void;

    Passing `chunk` as `null` signals the end of the stream (EOF) and behaves the same as `readable.push(null)`, after which no more data can be written. The EOF signal is put at the end of the buffer and any buffered data will still be flushed.

    The `readable.unshift()` method pushes a chunk of data back into the internal buffer. This is useful in certain situations where a stream is being consumed by code that needs to "un-consume" some amount of data that it has optimistically pulled out of the source, so that the data can be passed on to some other party.

    The `stream.unshift(chunk)` method cannot be called after the `'end'` event has been emitted or a runtime error will be thrown.

    Developers using `stream.unshift()` often should consider switching to use of a `Transform` stream instead. See the `API for stream implementers` section for more information.

    ```
    // Pull off a header delimited by \n\n.
    // Use unshift() if we get too much.
    // Call the callback with (error, header, stream).
    import { StringDecoder } from 'node:string_decoder';
    function parseHeader(stream, callback) {
      stream.on('error', callback);
      stream.on('readable', onReadable);
      const decoder = new StringDecoder('utf8');
      let header = '';
      function onReadable() {
        let chunk;
        while (null !== (chunk = stream.read())) {
          const str = decoder.write(chunk);
          if (str.includes('\n\n')) {
            // Found the header boundary.
            const split = str.split(/\n\n/);
            header += split.shift();
            const remaining = split.join('\n\n');
            const buf = Buffer.from(remaining, 'utf8');
            stream.removeListener('error', callback);
            // Remove the 'readable' listener before unshifting.
            stream.removeListener('readable', onReadable);
            if (buf.length)
              stream.unshift(buf);
            // Now the body of the message can be read from the stream.
            callback(null, header, stream);
            return;
          }
          // Still reading the header.
          header += str;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Unlike push, `stream.unshift(chunk)` will not end the reading process by resetting the internal reading state of the stream. This can cause unexpected results if `readable.unshift()` is called during a read (i.e. from within a \_read implementation on a custom stream). Following the call to `readable.unshift()` with an immediate push will reset the reading state appropriately, however it is best to simply avoid calling `readable.unshift()` while in the process of performing a read.

    @param chunk

    Chunk of data to unshift onto the read queue. For streams not operating in object mode, `chunk` must be a {string}, {Buffer}, {TypedArray}, {DataView} or `null`. For object mode streams, `chunk` may be any JavaScript value.

    Encoding of string chunks. Must be a valid `Buffer` encoding, such as `'utf8'` or `'ascii'`.

  + [wrap](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/wrap)(

    stream: ReadableStream

    ): this;

    Prior to Node.js 0.10, streams did not implement the entire `node:stream` module API as it is currently defined. (See `Compatibility` for more information.)

    When using an older Node.js library that emits `'data'` events and has a pause method that is advisory only, the `readable.wrap()` method can be used to create a `Readable` stream that uses the old stream as its data source.

    It will rarely be necessary to use `readable.wrap()` but the method has been provided as a convenience for interacting with older Node.js applications and libraries.

    ```
    import { OldReader } from './old-api-module.js';
    import { Readable } from 'node:stream';
    const oreader = new OldReader();
    const myReader = new Readable().wrap(oreader);

    myReader.on('readable', () => {
      myReader.read(); // etc.
    });
    ```

  + [write](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Decipheriv/write)(

    chunk: any,

    callback?: (error: undefined | null | [Error](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Error)) => void

    ): boolean;

    The `writable.write()` method writes some data to the stream, and calls the supplied `callback` once the data has been fully handled. If an error occurs, the `callback` will be called with the error as its first argument. The `callback` is called asynchronously and before `'error'` is emitted.

    The return value is `true` if the internal buffer is less than the `highWaterMark` configured when the stream was created after admitting `chunk`. If `false` is returned, further attempts to write data to the stream should stop until the `'drain'` event is emitted.

    While a stream is not draining, calls to `write()` will buffer `chunk`, and return false. Once all currently buffered chunks are drained (accepted for delivery by the operating system), the `'drain'` event will be emitted. Once `write()` returns false, do not write more chunks until the `'drain'` event is emitted. While calling `write()` on a stream that is not draining is allowed, Node.js will buffer all written chunks until maximum memory usage occurs, at which point it will abort unconditionally. Even before it aborts, high memory usage will cause poor garbage collector performance and high RSS (which is not typically released back to the system, even after the memory is no longer required). Since TCP sockets may never drain if the remote peer does not read the data, writing a socket that is not draining may lead to a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

    Writing data while the stream is not draining is particularly problematic for a `Transform`, because the `Transform` streams are paused by default until they are piped or a `'data'` or `'readable'` event handler is added.

    If the data to be written can be generated or fetched on demand, it is recommended to encapsulate the logic into a `Readable` and use pipe. However, if calling `write()` is preferred, it is possible to respect backpressure and avoid memory issues using the `'drain'` event:

    ```
    function write(data, cb) {
      if (!stream.write(data)) {
        stream.once('drain', cb);
      } else {
        process.nextTick(cb);
      }
    }

    // Wait for cb to be called before doing any other write.
    write('hello', () => {
      console.log('Write completed, do more writes now.');
    });
    ```

    A `Writable` stream in object mode will always ignore the `encoding` argument.

    @returns

    `false` if the stream wishes for the calling code to wait for the `'drain'` event to be emitted before continuing to write additional data; otherwise `true`.

    ): Disposable;

    Listens once to the `abort` event on the provided `signal`.

    Listening to the `abort` event on abort signals is unsafe and may lead to resource leaks since another third party with the signal can call `e.stopImmediatePropagation()`. Unfortunately Node.js cannot change this since it would violate the web standard. Additionally, the original API makes it easy to forget to remove listeners.

    This API allows safely using `AbortSignal`s in Node.js APIs by solving these two issues by listening to the event such that `stopImmediatePropagation` does not prevent the listener from running.

    Returns a disposable so that it may be unsubscribed from more easily.

    ```
    import { addAbortListener } from 'node:events';

    function example(signal) {
      let disposable;
      try {

    Creates a `Promise` that is fulfilled when the `EventEmitter` emits the given event or that is rejected if the `EventEmitter` emits `'error'` while waiting. The `Promise` will resolve with an array of all the arguments emitted to the given event.

    This method is intentionally generic and works with the web platform [EventTarget](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-eventtarget) interface, which has no special`'error'` event semantics and does not listen to the `'error'` event.

    ```
    import { once, EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    import process from 'node:process';

    const ee = new EventEmitter();

    process.nextTick(() => {
      ee.emit('myevent', 42);
    });

    const [value] = await once(ee, 'myevent');
    console.log(value);

    const err = new Error('kaboom');
    process.nextTick(() => {
      ee.emit('error', err);
    });

    try {
      await once(ee, 'myevent');
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('error happened', err);
    }
    ```

    The special handling of the `'error'` event is only used when `events.once()` is used to wait for another event. If `events.once()` is used to wait for the '`error'` event itself, then it is treated as any other kind of event without special handling:

    ```
    import { EventEmitter, once } from 'node:events';

    const ee = new EventEmitter();

    once(ee, 'error')
      .then(([err]) => console.log('ok', err.message))
      .catch((err) => console.error('error', err.message));

    ee.emit('error', new Error('boom'));

    // Prints: ok boom
    ```

    An `AbortSignal` can be used to cancel waiting for the event:

    ```
    import { EventEmitter, once } from 'node:events';

    const ee = new EventEmitter();
    const ac = new AbortController();

    async function foo(emitter, event, signal) {

          console.error('Waiting for the event was canceled!');
        } else {
          console.error('There was an error', error.message);
        }
      }

    inputEncoding?: [BinaryToTextEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/BinaryToTextEncoding),

    outputEncoding?: 'latin1' | 'base64' | 'base64url' | 'hex',

    format?: 'uncompressed' | 'compressed' | 'hybrid'

    ): string | NonSharedBuffer;

    Converts the EC Diffie-Hellman public key specified by `key` and `curve` to the format specified by `format`. The `format` argument specifies point encoding and can be `'compressed'`, `'uncompressed'` or `'hybrid'`. The supplied key is interpreted using the specified `inputEncoding`, and the returned key is encoded using the specified `outputEncoding`.

    Use getCurves to obtain a list of available curve names. On recent OpenSSL releases, `openssl ecparam -list_curves` will also display the name and description of each available elliptic curve.

    If `format` is not specified the point will be returned in `'uncompressed'` format.

    If the `inputEncoding` is not provided, `key` is expected to be a `Buffer`, `TypedArray`, or `DataView`.

    Example (uncompressing a key):

    ```
    const {
      createECDH,
      ECDH,
    } = await import('node:crypto');

    const ecdh = createECDH('secp256k1');
    ecdh.generateKeys();

    const compressedKey = ecdh.getPublicKey('hex', 'compressed');

    const uncompressedKey = ECDH.convertKey(compressedKey,
                                            'secp256k1',
                                            'hex',
                                            'hex',
                                            'uncompressed');

    // The converted key and the uncompressed public key should be the same
    console.log(uncompressedKey === ecdh.getPublicKey('hex'));
    ```

    @param inputEncoding

    The `encoding` of the `key` string.

    @param outputEncoding

    The `encoding` of the return value.
* ### class [Hash](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash)

  The `Hash` class is a utility for creating hash digests of data. It can be used in one of two ways:

  + As a `stream` that is both readable and writable, where data is written to produce a computed hash digest on the readable side, or
  + Using the `hash.update()` and `hash.digest()` methods to produce the computed hash.

  The createHash method is used to create `Hash` instances. `Hash`objects are not to be created directly using the `new` keyword.

  Example: Using `Hash` objects as streams:

  ```
  const {
    createHash,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const hash = createHash('sha256');

  hash.on('readable', () => {
    // Only one element is going to be produced by the
    // hash stream.
    const data = hash.read();
    if (data) {
      console.log(data.toString('hex'));
      // Prints:
      //   6a2da20943931e9834fc12cfe5bb47bbd9ae43489a30726962b576f4e3993e50
    }
  });

  hash.write('some data to hash');
  hash.end();
  ```

  Example: Using `Hash` and piped streams:

  ```
  import { createReadStream } from 'node:fs';
  import { stdout } from 'node:process';
  const { createHash } = await import('node:crypto');

  const hash = createHash('sha256');

  const input = createReadStream('test.js');
  input.pipe(hash).setEncoding('hex').pipe(stdout);
  ```

  Example: Using the `hash.update()` and `hash.digest()` methods:

  ```
  const {
    createHash,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const hash = createHash('sha256');

  hash.update('some data to hash');
  console.log(hash.digest('hex'));
  // Prints:
  //   6a2da20943931e9834fc12cfe5bb47bbd9ae43489a30726962b576f4e3993e50
  ```

  + [allowHalfOpen](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/allowHalfOpen): boolean

    If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`.

    This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing `Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
  + readonly [closed](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/closed): boolean

    Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
  + [destroyed](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/destroyed): boolean

    Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
  + readonly [errored](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/errored): null | [Error](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Error)

    Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
  + [readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/readable): boolean

    Is `true` if it is safe to call read, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
  + readonly [readableAborted](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/readableAborted): boolean

    Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.
  + readonly [readableDidRead](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/readableDidRead): boolean

    Returns whether `'data'` has been emitted.
  + readonly [readableEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/readableEncoding): null | BufferEncoding

    Getter for the property `encoding` of a given `Readable` stream. The `encoding` property can be set using the setEncoding method.
  + readonly [readableEnded](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/readableEnded): boolean

    Becomes `true` when [`'end'`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v24.x/api/stream.html#event-end) event is emitted.
  + readonly [readableFlowing](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/readableFlowing): null | boolean

    This property reflects the current state of a `Readable` stream as described in the [Three states](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v24.x/api/stream.html#three-states) section.
  + readonly [readableHighWaterMark](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/readableHighWaterMark): number

    Returns the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Readable`.
  + readonly [readableLength](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/readableLength): number

    This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be read. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
  + readonly [readableObjectMode](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/readableObjectMode): boolean

    Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
  + readonly [writable](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/writable): boolean

    Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
  + readonly [writableAborted](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/writableAborted): boolean

    Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'finish'`.
  + readonly [writableCorked](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/writableCorked): number

    Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
  + readonly [writableEnded](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/writableEnded): boolean

    Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
  + readonly [writableFinished](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/writableFinished): boolean

    Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.
  + readonly [writableHighWaterMark](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/writableHighWaterMark): number

    Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
  + readonly [writableLength](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/writableLength): number

    This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.
  + readonly [writableNeedDrain](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/writableNeedDrain): boolean

    Is `true` if the stream's buffer has been full and stream will emit `'drain'`.
  + readonly [writableObjectMode](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/writableObjectMode): boolean

    Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
  + static [captureRejections](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/captureRejections): boolean

    Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type)

    Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
  + readonly static [captureRejectionSymbol](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/captureRejectionSymbol): typeof [captureRejectionSymbol](https://bun.com/reference/node/events/default/captureRejectionSymbol)

    Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')`

    See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
  + static [defaultMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/defaultMaxListeners): number

    By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for *all*`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners` property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError` is thrown.

    Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects *all* `EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`.

    This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single `EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()` methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning:

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const emitter = new EventEmitter();
    emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1);
    emitter.once('event', () => {
      // do stuff
      emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0));
    });
    ```

    The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings.

    The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
  + readonly static [errorMonitor](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/errorMonitor): typeof [errorMonitor](https://bun.com/reference/node/events/default/errorMonitor)

    This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'` events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular `'error'` listeners are called.

    Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an `'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.

    Creates a new `Hash` object that contains a deep copy of the internal state of the current `Hash` object.

    The optional `options` argument controls stream behavior. For XOF hash functions such as `'shake256'`, the `outputLength` option can be used to specify the desired output length in bytes.

    An error is thrown when an attempt is made to copy the `Hash` object after its `hash.digest()` method has been called.

  + [cork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/cork)(): void;

    The `writable.cork()` method forces all written data to be buffered in memory. The buffered data will be flushed when either the uncork or end methods are called.

    The primary intent of `writable.cork()` is to accommodate a situation in which several small chunks are written to the stream in rapid succession. Instead of immediately forwarding them to the underlying destination, `writable.cork()` buffers all the chunks until `writable.uncork()` is called, which will pass them all to `writable._writev()`, if present. This prevents a head-of-line blocking situation where data is being buffered while waiting for the first small chunk to be processed. However, use of `writable.cork()` without implementing `writable._writev()` may have an adverse effect on throughput.

    See also: `writable.uncork()`, `writable._writev()`.

    Once `destroy()` has been called any further calls will be a no-op and no further errors except from `_destroy()` may be emitted as `'error'`.

    Implementors should not override this method, but instead implement `readable._destroy()`.

    fn: (data: any, options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>) => boolean | Promise<boolean>,

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<boolean>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.every` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream to check if all awaited return values are truthy value for *fn*. Once an *fn* call on a chunk `await`ed return value is falsy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with `false`. If all of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a truthy value, the promise is fulfilled with `true`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise evaluating to `true` if *fn* returned a truthy value for every one of the chunks.
  + [filter](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/filter)(

    fn: (data: any, options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>) => boolean | Promise<boolean>,

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method allows filtering the stream. For each chunk in the stream the *fn* function will be called and if it returns a truthy value, the chunk will be passed to the result stream. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed.

    @param fn

    a function to filter chunks from the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a stream filtered with the predicate *fn*.
  + [find](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/find)<T>(

    fn: (data: any, options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>) => data is T,

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<undefined | T>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.find` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream to find a chunk with a truthy value for *fn*. Once an *fn* call's awaited return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with value for which *fn* returned a truthy value. If all of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a falsy value, the promise is fulfilled with `undefined`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise evaluating to the first chunk for which *fn* evaluated with a truthy value, or `undefined` if no element was found.

    [find](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/find)(

    fn: (data: any, options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>) => boolean | Promise<boolean>,

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method returns a new stream by applying the given callback to each chunk of the stream and then flattening the result.

    It is possible to return a stream or another iterable or async iterable from *fn* and the result streams will be merged (flattened) into the returned stream.

    @param fn

    a function to map over every chunk in the stream. May be async. May be a stream or generator.

    @returns

    a stream flat-mapped with the function *fn*.
  + [forEach](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/forEach)(

    fn: (data: any, options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>) => void | Promise<void>,

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<void>;

    This method allows iterating a stream. For each chunk in the stream the *fn* function will be called. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed.

    This method is different from `for await...of` loops in that it can optionally process chunks concurrently. In addition, a `forEach` iteration can only be stopped by having passed a `signal` option and aborting the related AbortController while `for await...of` can be stopped with `break` or `return`. In either case the stream will be destroyed.

    This method is different from listening to the `'data'` event in that it uses the `readable` event in the underlying machinary and can limit the number of concurrent *fn* calls.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise for when the stream has finished.
  + [getMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/getMaxListeners)(): number;

    Returns the current max listener value for the `EventEmitter` which is either set by `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` or defaults to EventEmitter.defaultMaxListeners.
  + [isPaused](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/isPaused)(): boolean;

    The `readable.isPaused()` method returns the current operating state of the `Readable`. This is used primarily by the mechanism that underlies the `readable.pipe()` method. In most typical cases, there will be no reason to use this method directly.

    ```
    const readable = new stream.Readable();

    readable.isPaused(); // === false
    readable.pause();
    readable.isPaused(); // === true
    readable.resume();
    readable.isPaused(); // === false
    ```
  + [iterator](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/iterator)(

    options?: { destroyOnReturn: boolean }

    ): AsyncIterator<any>;

    The iterator created by this method gives users the option to cancel the destruction of the stream if the `for await...of` loop is exited by `return`, `break`, or `throw`, or if the iterator should destroy the stream if the stream emitted an error during iteration.
  + [listenerCount](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/listenerCount)<K>(

    eventName: string | symbol,

    listener?: Function

    ): number;

    Returns the number of listeners listening for the event named `eventName`. If `listener` is provided, it will return how many times the listener is found in the list of the listeners of the event.

    @param eventName

    The name of the event being listened for

    @param listener

    The event handler function
  + [listeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/listeners)<K>(

    eventName: string | symbol

    ): Function[];

    Returns a copy of the array of listeners for the event named `eventName`.

    ```
    server.on('connection', (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    });
    console.log(util.inspect(server.listeners('connection')));
    // Prints: [ [Function] ]

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method allows mapping over the stream. The *fn* function will be called for every chunk in the stream. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed before being passed to the result stream.

    @param fn

    a function to map over every chunk in the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a stream mapped with the function *fn*.
  + [off](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/off)<K>(

    Alias for `emitter.removeListener()`.
  + [on](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/on)(

    event: 'close',

    listener: () => void

    ): this;

    Adds the `listener` function to the end of the listeners array for the event named `eventName`. No checks are made to see if the `listener` has already been added. Multiple calls passing the same combination of `eventName` and `listener` will result in the `listener` being added, and called, multiple times.

    ```
    server.on('connection', (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    });
    ```

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

    By default, event listeners are invoked in the order they are added. The `emitter.prependListener()` method can be used as an alternative to add the event listener to the beginning of the listeners array.

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const myEE = new EventEmitter();
    myEE.on('foo', () => console.log('a'));
    myEE.prependListener('foo', () => console.log('b'));

    The `readable.pause()` method will cause a stream in flowing mode to stop emitting `'data'` events, switching out of flowing mode. Any data that becomes available will remain in the internal buffer.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
    readable.on('data', (chunk) => {

  + [read](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/read)(

    size?: number

    ): any;

    The `readable.read()` method reads data out of the internal buffer and returns it. If no data is available to be read, `null` is returned. By default, the data is returned as a `Buffer` object unless an encoding has been specified using the `readable.setEncoding()` method or the stream is operating in object mode.

    The optional `size` argument specifies a specific number of bytes to read. If `size` bytes are not available to be read, `null` will be returned *unless* the stream has ended, in which case all of the data remaining in the internal buffer will be returned.

    If the `size` argument is not specified, all of the data contained in the internal buffer will be returned.

    The `size` argument must be less than or equal to 1 GiB.

    The `readable.read()` method should only be called on `Readable` streams operating in paused mode. In flowing mode, `readable.read()` is called automatically until the internal buffer is fully drained.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();

    // 'readable' may be triggered multiple times as data is buffered in
    readable.on('readable', () => {
      let chunk;
      console.log('Stream is readable (new data received in buffer)');
      // Use a loop to make sure we read all currently available data
      while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
        console.log(`Read ${chunk.length} bytes of data...`);
      }
    });

    // 'end' will be triggered once when there is no more data available
    readable.on('end', () => {
      console.log('Reached end of stream.');
    });
    ```

    Each call to `readable.read()` returns a chunk of data, or `null`. The chunks are not concatenated. A `while` loop is necessary to consume all data currently in the buffer. When reading a large file `.read()` may return `null`, having consumed all buffered content so far, but there is still more data to come not yet buffered. In this case a new `'readable'` event will be emitted when there is more data in the buffer. Finally the `'end'` event will be emitted when there is no more data to come.

    Therefore to read a file's whole contents from a `readable`, it is necessary to collect chunks across multiple `'readable'` events:

    ```
    const chunks = [];

    readable.on('readable', () => {
      let chunk;
      while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
        chunks.push(chunk);
      }
    });

    readable.on('end', () => {
      const content = chunks.join('');
    });
    ```

    A `Readable` stream in object mode will always return a single item from a call to `readable.read(size)`, regardless of the value of the `size` argument.

    If the `readable.read()` method returns a chunk of data, a `'data'` event will also be emitted.

    Calling read after the `'end'` event has been emitted will return `null`. No runtime error will be raised.

    Optional argument to specify how much data to read.

    This method calls *fn* on each chunk of the stream in order, passing it the result from the calculation on the previous element. It returns a promise for the final value of the reduction.

    If no *initial* value is supplied the first chunk of the stream is used as the initial value. If the stream is empty, the promise is rejected with a `TypeError` with the `ERR_INVALID_ARGS` code property.

    The reducer function iterates the stream element-by-element which means that there is no *concurrency* parameter or parallelism. To perform a reduce concurrently, you can extract the async function to `readable.map` method.

    @param fn

    a reducer function to call over every chunk in the stream. Async or not.

    @param initial

    the initial value to use in the reduction.

  + [removeAllListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/removeAllListeners)(

    eventName?: string | symbol

    ): this;

    Removes all listeners, or those of the specified `eventName`.

    It is bad practice to remove listeners added elsewhere in the code, particularly when the `EventEmitter` instance was created by some other component or module (e.g. sockets or file streams).

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [removeListener](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/removeListener)(

    event: 'close',

    listener: () => void

    ): this;

    Removes the specified `listener` from the listener array for the event named `eventName`.

    ```
    const callback = (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    };
    server.on('connection', callback);
    // ...
    server.removeListener('connection', callback);
    ```

    `removeListener()` will remove, at most, one instance of a listener from the listener array. If any single listener has been added multiple times to the listener array for the specified `eventName`, then `removeListener()` must be called multiple times to remove each instance.

    Once an event is emitted, all listeners attached to it at the time of emitting are called in order. This implies that any `removeListener()` or `removeAllListeners()` calls *after* emitting and *before* the last listener finishes execution will not remove them from`emit()` in progress. Subsequent events behave as expected.

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}
    const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

    const callbackA = () => {
      console.log('A');
      myEmitter.removeListener('event', callbackB);
    };

    const callbackB = () => {
      console.log('B');
    };

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackA);

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackB);

    // callbackA removes listener callbackB but it will still be called.
    // Internal listener array at time of emit [callbackA, callbackB]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    //   B

    // callbackB is now removed.
    // Internal listener array [callbackA]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    ```

    Because listeners are managed using an internal array, calling this will change the position indices of any listener registered *after* the listener being removed. This will not impact the order in which listeners are called, but it means that any copies of the listener array as returned by the `emitter.listeners()` method will need to be recreated.

    When a single function has been added as a handler multiple times for a single event (as in the example below), `removeListener()` will remove the most recently added instance. In the example the `once('ping')` listener is removed:

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const ee = new EventEmitter();

    function pong() {
      console.log('pong');
    }

    ee.on('ping', pong);
    ee.once('ping', pong);
    ee.removeListener('ping', pong);

    ee.emit('ping');
    ee.emit('ping');
    ```

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

  + [resume](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/resume)(): this;

    The `readable.resume()` method causes an explicitly paused `Readable` stream to resume emitting `'data'` events, switching the stream into flowing mode.

    The `readable.resume()` method can be used to fully consume the data from a stream without actually processing any of that data:

    ```
    getReadableStreamSomehow()
      .resume()
      .on('end', () => {
        console.log('Reached the end, but did not read anything.');
      });
    ```

    The `readable.resume()` method has no effect if there is a `'readable'` event listener.
  + [setDefaultEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/setDefaultEncoding)(

    ): this;

    The `writable.setDefaultEncoding()` method sets the default `encoding` for a `Writable` stream.

    @param encoding

    The new default encoding
  + [setEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/setEncoding)(

    encoding: BufferEncoding

    ): this;

    The `readable.setEncoding()` method sets the character encoding for data read from the `Readable` stream.

    By default, no encoding is assigned and stream data will be returned as `Buffer` objects. Setting an encoding causes the stream data to be returned as strings of the specified encoding rather than as `Buffer` objects. For instance, calling `readable.setEncoding('utf8')` will cause the output data to be interpreted as UTF-8 data, and passed as strings. Calling `readable.setEncoding('hex')` will cause the data to be encoded in hexadecimal string format.

    The `Readable` stream will properly handle multi-byte characters delivered through the stream that would otherwise become improperly decoded if simply pulled from the stream as `Buffer` objects.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
    readable.setEncoding('utf8');
    readable.on('data', (chunk) => {
      assert.equal(typeof chunk, 'string');
      console.log('Got %d characters of string data:', chunk.length);
    });
    ```

    @param encoding

    The encoding to use.
  + [setMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/setMaxListeners)(

    n: number

    ): this;

    By default `EventEmitter`s will print a warning if more than `10` listeners are added for a particular event. This is a useful default that helps finding memory leaks. The `emitter.setMaxListeners()` method allows the limit to be modified for this specific `EventEmitter` instance. The value can be set to `Infinity` (or `0`) to indicate an unlimited number of listeners.

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [some](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/some)(

    fn: (data: any, options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>) => boolean | Promise<boolean>,

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<boolean>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.some` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream until the awaited return value is `true` (or any truthy value). Once an *fn* call on a chunk `await`ed return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with `true`. If none of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a truthy value, the promise is fulfilled with `false`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise evaluating to `true` if *fn* returned a truthy value for at least one of the chunks.
  + [take](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/take)(

    options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>

    This method returns a new stream with the first *limit* chunks.

    @param limit

    the number of chunks to take from the readable.

    @returns

    a stream with *limit* chunks taken.
  + [toArray](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/toArray)(

    options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>

    ): Promise<any[]>;

    This method allows easily obtaining the contents of a stream.

    As this method reads the entire stream into memory, it negates the benefits of streams. It's intended for interoperability and convenience, not as the primary way to consume streams.

    @returns

    a promise containing an array with the contents of the stream.
  + [uncork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/uncork)(): void;

    The `writable.uncork()` method flushes all data buffered since cork was called.

    When using `writable.cork()` and `writable.uncork()` to manage the buffering of writes to a stream, defer calls to `writable.uncork()` using `process.nextTick()`. Doing so allows batching of all `writable.write()` calls that occur within a given Node.js event loop phase.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => stream.uncork());
    ```

    If the `writable.cork()` method is called multiple times on a stream, the same number of calls to `writable.uncork()` must be called to flush the buffered data.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => {
      stream.uncork();
      // The data will not be flushed until uncork() is called a second time.
      stream.uncork();
    });
    ```

    See also: `writable.cork()`.
  + [unpipe](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/unpipe)(

    destination?: WritableStream

    ): this;

    The `readable.unpipe()` method detaches a `Writable` stream previously attached using the pipe method.

    If the `destination` is not specified, then *all* pipes are detached.

    If the `destination` is specified, but no pipe is set up for it, then the method does nothing.

    ```
    import fs from 'node:fs';
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
    const writable = fs.createWriteStream('file.txt');
    // All the data from readable goes into 'file.txt',
    // but only for the first second.
    readable.pipe(writable);
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Stop writing to file.txt.');
      readable.unpipe(writable);
      console.log('Manually close the file stream.');
      writable.end();
    }, 1000);
    ```

    @param destination

    Optional specific stream to unpipe
  + [unshift](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/unshift)(

    chunk: any,

    encoding?: BufferEncoding

    ): void;

    Passing `chunk` as `null` signals the end of the stream (EOF) and behaves the same as `readable.push(null)`, after which no more data can be written. The EOF signal is put at the end of the buffer and any buffered data will still be flushed.

    The `readable.unshift()` method pushes a chunk of data back into the internal buffer. This is useful in certain situations where a stream is being consumed by code that needs to "un-consume" some amount of data that it has optimistically pulled out of the source, so that the data can be passed on to some other party.

    The `stream.unshift(chunk)` method cannot be called after the `'end'` event has been emitted or a runtime error will be thrown.

    Developers using `stream.unshift()` often should consider switching to use of a `Transform` stream instead. See the `API for stream implementers` section for more information.

    ```
    // Pull off a header delimited by \n\n.
    // Use unshift() if we get too much.
    // Call the callback with (error, header, stream).
    import { StringDecoder } from 'node:string_decoder';
    function parseHeader(stream, callback) {
      stream.on('error', callback);
      stream.on('readable', onReadable);
      const decoder = new StringDecoder('utf8');
      let header = '';
      function onReadable() {
        let chunk;
        while (null !== (chunk = stream.read())) {
          const str = decoder.write(chunk);
          if (str.includes('\n\n')) {
            // Found the header boundary.
            const split = str.split(/\n\n/);
            header += split.shift();
            const remaining = split.join('\n\n');
            const buf = Buffer.from(remaining, 'utf8');
            stream.removeListener('error', callback);
            // Remove the 'readable' listener before unshifting.
            stream.removeListener('readable', onReadable);
            if (buf.length)
              stream.unshift(buf);
            // Now the body of the message can be read from the stream.
            callback(null, header, stream);
            return;
          }
          // Still reading the header.
          header += str;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Unlike push, `stream.unshift(chunk)` will not end the reading process by resetting the internal reading state of the stream. This can cause unexpected results if `readable.unshift()` is called during a read (i.e. from within a \_read implementation on a custom stream). Following the call to `readable.unshift()` with an immediate push will reset the reading state appropriately, however it is best to simply avoid calling `readable.unshift()` while in the process of performing a read.

    @param chunk

    Chunk of data to unshift onto the read queue. For streams not operating in object mode, `chunk` must be a {string}, {Buffer}, {TypedArray}, {DataView} or `null`. For object mode streams, `chunk` may be any JavaScript value.

    @param encoding

    Encoding of string chunks. Must be a valid `Buffer` encoding, such as `'utf8'` or `'ascii'`.

    The `encoding` of the `data` string.
  + [wrap](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/wrap)(

    stream: ReadableStream

    ): this;

    Prior to Node.js 0.10, streams did not implement the entire `node:stream` module API as it is currently defined. (See `Compatibility` for more information.)

    When using an older Node.js library that emits `'data'` events and has a pause method that is advisory only, the `readable.wrap()` method can be used to create a `Readable` stream that uses the old stream as its data source.

    It will rarely be necessary to use `readable.wrap()` but the method has been provided as a convenience for interacting with older Node.js applications and libraries.

    ```
    import { OldReader } from './old-api-module.js';
    import { Readable } from 'node:stream';
    const oreader = new OldReader();
    const myReader = new Readable().wrap(oreader);

    myReader.on('readable', () => {
      myReader.read(); // etc.
    });
    ```

    @param stream

    An "old style" readable stream
  + [write](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/write)(

    chunk: any,

    callback?: (error: undefined | null | [Error](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Error)) => void

    ): boolean;

    The `writable.write()` method writes some data to the stream, and calls the supplied `callback` once the data has been fully handled. If an error occurs, the `callback` will be called with the error as its first argument. The `callback` is called asynchronously and before `'error'` is emitted.

    The return value is `true` if the internal buffer is less than the `highWaterMark` configured when the stream was created after admitting `chunk`. If `false` is returned, further attempts to write data to the stream should stop until the `'drain'` event is emitted.

    While a stream is not draining, calls to `write()` will buffer `chunk`, and return false. Once all currently buffered chunks are drained (accepted for delivery by the operating system), the `'drain'` event will be emitted. Once `write()` returns false, do not write more chunks until the `'drain'` event is emitted. While calling `write()` on a stream that is not draining is allowed, Node.js will buffer all written chunks until maximum memory usage occurs, at which point it will abort unconditionally. Even before it aborts, high memory usage will cause poor garbage collector performance and high RSS (which is not typically released back to the system, even after the memory is no longer required). Since TCP sockets may never drain if the remote peer does not read the data, writing a socket that is not draining may lead to a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

    Writing data while the stream is not draining is particularly problematic for a `Transform`, because the `Transform` streams are paused by default until they are piped or a `'data'` or `'readable'` event handler is added.

    If the data to be written can be generated or fetched on demand, it is recommended to encapsulate the logic into a `Readable` and use pipe. However, if calling `write()` is preferred, it is possible to respect backpressure and avoid memory issues using the `'drain'` event:

    ```
    function write(data, cb) {
      if (!stream.write(data)) {
        stream.once('drain', cb);
      } else {
        process.nextTick(cb);

    A `Writable` stream in object mode will always ignore the `encoding` argument.

    @param chunk

    Optional data to write. For streams not operating in object mode, `chunk` must be a {string}, {Buffer}, {TypedArray} or {DataView}. For object mode streams, `chunk` may be any JavaScript value other than `null`.

    @param callback

    Callback for when this chunk of data is flushed.

    @returns

    `false` if the stream wishes for the calling code to wait for the `'drain'` event to be emitted before continuing to write additional data; otherwise `true`.

    [write](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Hash/write)(

    chunk: any,

    encoding: BufferEncoding,

    callback?: (error: undefined | null | [Error](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Error)) => void

    ): boolean;

    The `writable.write()` method writes some data to the stream, and calls the supplied `callback` once the data has been fully handled. If an error occurs, the `callback` will be called with the error as its first argument. The `callback` is called asynchronously and before `'error'` is emitted.

    The return value is `true` if the internal buffer is less than the `highWaterMark` configured when the stream was created after admitting `chunk`. If `false` is returned, further attempts to write data to the stream should stop until the `'drain'` event is emitted.

    While a stream is not draining, calls to `write()` will buffer `chunk`, and return false. Once all currently buffered chunks are drained (accepted for delivery by the operating system), the `'drain'` event will be emitted. Once `write()` returns false, do not write more chunks until the `'drain'` event is emitted. While calling `write()` on a stream that is not draining is allowed, Node.js will buffer all written chunks until maximum memory usage occurs, at which point it will abort unconditionally. Even before it aborts, high memory usage will cause poor garbage collector performance and high RSS (which is not typically released back to the system, even after the memory is no longer required). Since TCP sockets may never drain if the remote peer does not read the data, writing a socket that is not draining may lead to a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

    Writing data while the stream is not draining is particularly problematic for a `Transform`, because the `Transform` streams are paused by default until they are piped or a `'data'` or `'readable'` event handler is added.

    If the data to be written can be generated or fetched on demand, it is recommended to encapsulate the logic into a `Readable` and use pipe. However, if calling `write()` is preferred, it is possible to respect backpressure and avoid memory issues using the `'drain'` event:

    ```
    function write(data, cb) {
      if (!stream.write(data)) {
        stream.once('drain', cb);
      } else {
        process.nextTick(cb);
      }
    }

    // Wait for cb to be called before doing any other write.
    write('hello', () => {
      console.log('Write completed, do more writes now.');
    });
    ```

    A `Writable` stream in object mode will always ignore the `encoding` argument.

    @param chunk

    Optional data to write. For streams not operating in object mode, `chunk` must be a {string}, {Buffer}, {TypedArray} or {DataView}. For object mode streams, `chunk` may be any JavaScript value other than `null`.

    @param encoding

    The encoding, if `chunk` is a string.

    @param callback

    Callback for when this chunk of data is flushed.

    @returns

    `false` if the stream wishes for the calling code to wait for the `'drain'` event to be emitted before continuing to write additional data; otherwise `true`.

    resource: (event: [Event](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Event)) => void

    ): Disposable;

    Listens once to the `abort` event on the provided `signal`.

    Listening to the `abort` event on abort signals is unsafe and may lead to resource leaks since another third party with the signal can call `e.stopImmediatePropagation()`. Unfortunately Node.js cannot change this since it would violate the web standard. Additionally, the original API makes it easy to forget to remove listeners.

    This API allows safely using `AbortSignal`s in Node.js APIs by solving these two issues by listening to the event such that `stopImmediatePropagation` does not prevent the listener from running.

    Returns a disposable so that it may be unsubscribed from more easily.

    ```
    import { addAbortListener } from 'node:events';

    function example(signal) {
      let disposable;
      try {
        signal.addEventListener('abort', (e) => e.stopImmediatePropagation());
        disposable = addAbortListener(signal, (e) => {

        });
      } finally {
        disposable?.[Symbol.dispose]();
      }

* ### class [KeyObject](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/KeyObject)

  Node.js uses a `KeyObject` class to represent a symmetric or asymmetric key, and each kind of key exposes different functions. The createSecretKey, createPublicKey and createPrivateKey methods are used to create `KeyObject`instances. `KeyObject` objects are not to be created directly using the `new`keyword.

  Most applications should consider using the new `KeyObject` API instead of passing keys as strings or `Buffer`s due to improved security features.

  `KeyObject` instances can be passed to other threads via `postMessage()`. The receiver obtains a cloned `KeyObject`, and the `KeyObject` does not need to be listed in the `transferList` argument.

  + [asymmetricKeyDetails](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/KeyObject/asymmetricKeyDetails)?: [AsymmetricKeyDetails](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/AsymmetricKeyDetails)

    This property exists only on asymmetric keys. Depending on the type of the key, this object contains information about the key. None of the information obtained through this property can be used to uniquely identify a key or to compromise the security of the key.

    For RSA-PSS keys, if the key material contains a `RSASSA-PSS-params` sequence, the `hashAlgorithm`, `mgf1HashAlgorithm`, and `saltLength` properties will be set.

    Other key details might be exposed via this API using additional attributes.
  + [asymmetricKeyType](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/KeyObject/asymmetricKeyType)?: [KeyType](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/KeyType)

    For asymmetric keys, this property represents the type of the key. See the supported [asymmetric key types](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v24.x/api/crypto.html#asymmetric-key-types).

    This property is `undefined` for unrecognized `KeyObject` types and symmetric keys.

    The result type depends on the selected encoding format, when PEM the result is a string, when DER it will be a buffer containing the data encoded as DER, when [JWK](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517) it will be an object.

    When [JWK](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517) encoding format was selected, all other encoding options are ignored.

    PKCS#1, SEC1, and PKCS#8 type keys can be encrypted by using a combination of the `cipher` and `format` options. The PKCS#8 `type` can be used with any`format` to encrypt any key algorithm (RSA, EC, or DH) by specifying a`cipher`. PKCS#1 and SEC1 can only be encrypted by specifying a `cipher`when the PEM `format` is used. For maximum compatibility, use PKCS#8 for encrypted private keys. Since PKCS#8 defines its own encryption mechanism, PEM-level encryption is not supported when encrypting a PKCS#8 key.

* ### class [Sign](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Sign)

  The `Sign` class is a utility for generating signatures. It can be used in one of two ways:

  + As a writable `stream`, where data to be signed is written and the `sign.sign()` method is used to generate and return the signature, or
  + Using the `sign.update()` and `sign.sign()` methods to produce the signature.

  The createSign method is used to create `Sign` instances. The argument is the string name of the hash function to use. `Sign` objects are not to be created directly using the `new` keyword.

  Example: Using `Sign` and `Verify` objects as streams:

  ```
  const {
    generateKeyPairSync,
    createSign,
    createVerify,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const { privateKey, publicKey } = generateKeyPairSync('ec', {
    namedCurve: 'sect239k1',
  });

  const sign = createSign('SHA256');
  sign.write('some data to sign');
  sign.end();
  const signature = sign.sign(privateKey, 'hex');

  const verify = createVerify('SHA256');
  verify.write('some data to sign');
  verify.end();
  console.log(verify.verify(publicKey, signature, 'hex'));
  // Prints: true
  ```

  Example: Using the `sign.update()` and `verify.update()` methods:

  ```
  const {
    generateKeyPairSync,
    createSign,
    createVerify,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const { privateKey, publicKey } = generateKeyPairSync('rsa', {
    modulusLength: 2048,
  });

  const sign = createSign('SHA256');
  sign.update('some data to sign');
  sign.end();
  const signature = sign.sign(privateKey);

  const verify = createVerify('SHA256');
  verify.update('some data to sign');
  verify.end();
  console.log(verify.verify(publicKey, signature));
  // Prints: true
  ```

    Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'finish'`.

    Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.

    Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.

  + static [captureRejections](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Sign/captureRejections): boolean

    Value: [boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#Boolean_type)

    Change the default `captureRejections` option on all new `EventEmitter` objects.
  + readonly static [captureRejectionSymbol](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Sign/captureRejectionSymbol): typeof [captureRejectionSymbol](https://bun.com/reference/node/events/default/captureRejectionSymbol)

    Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')`

    See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
  + static [defaultMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Sign/defaultMaxListeners): number

    By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for *all*`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners` property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError` is thrown.

    Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects *all* `EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`.

    This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single `EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()` methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning:

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const emitter = new EventEmitter();
    emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1);
    emitter.once('event', () => {
      // do stuff
      emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0));
    });
    ```

    The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings.

    The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
  + readonly static [errorMonitor](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Sign/errorMonitor): typeof [errorMonitor](https://bun.com/reference/node/events/default/errorMonitor)

    This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'` events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular `'error'` listeners are called.

    Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an `'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.

  + [cork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Sign/cork)(): void;

    The `writable.cork()` method forces all written data to be buffered in memory. The buffered data will be flushed when either the uncork or end methods are called.

    The primary intent of `writable.cork()` is to accommodate a situation in which several small chunks are written to the stream in rapid succession. Instead of immediately forwarding them to the underlying destination, `writable.cork()` buffers all the chunks until `writable.uncork()` is called, which will pass them all to `writable._writev()`, if present. This prevents a head-of-line blocking situation where data is being buffered while waiting for the first small chunk to be processed. However, use of `writable.cork()` without implementing `writable._writev()` may have an adverse effect on throughput.

    See also: `writable.uncork()`, `writable._writev()`.
  + [destroy](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Sign/destroy)(

    error?: [Error](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Error)

    ): this;

    Destroy the stream. Optionally emit an `'error'` event, and emit a `'close'` event (unless `emitClose` is set to `false`). After this call, the writable stream has ended and subsequent calls to `write()` or `end()` will result in an `ERR_STREAM_DESTROYED` error. This is a destructive and immediate way to destroy a stream. Previous calls to `write()` may not have drained, and may trigger an `ERR_STREAM_DESTROYED` error. Use `end()` instead of destroy if data should flush before close, or wait for the `'drain'` event before destroying the stream.

    Once `destroy()` has been called any further calls will be a no-op and no further errors except from `_destroy()` may be emitted as `'error'`.

    Implementors should not override this method, but instead implement `writable._destroy()`.

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const emitter = new EventEmitter();

    // Returns a new Array with a function `onceWrapper` which has a property

    const listeners = emitter.rawListeners('log');
    const logFnWrapper = listeners[0];

    // Logs "log once" to the console and does not unbind the `once` event
    logFnWrapper.listener();

    // Logs "log once" to the console and removes the listener

  + [removeAllListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Sign/removeAllListeners)(

    eventName?: string | symbol

    ): this;

    Removes all listeners, or those of the specified `eventName`.

    It is bad practice to remove listeners added elsewhere in the code, particularly when the `EventEmitter` instance was created by some other component or module (e.g. sockets or file streams).

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [removeListener](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Sign/removeListener)(

    event: 'close',

    listener: () => void

    ): this;

    Removes the specified `listener` from the listener array for the event named `eventName`.

    ```
    const callback = (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    };
    server.on('connection', callback);
    // ...
    server.removeListener('connection', callback);
    ```

    `removeListener()` will remove, at most, one instance of a listener from the listener array. If any single listener has been added multiple times to the listener array for the specified `eventName`, then `removeListener()` must be called multiple times to remove each instance.

    Once an event is emitted, all listeners attached to it at the time of emitting are called in order. This implies that any `removeListener()` or `removeAllListeners()` calls *after* emitting and *before* the last listener finishes execution will not remove them from`emit()` in progress. Subsequent events behave as expected.

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}
    const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

    const callbackA = () => {
      console.log('A');
      myEmitter.removeListener('event', callbackB);
    };

    const callbackB = () => {
      console.log('B');
    };

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackA);

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackB);

    // callbackA removes listener callbackB but it will still be called.
    // Internal listener array at time of emit [callbackA, callbackB]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    //   B

    // callbackB is now removed.
    // Internal listener array [callbackA]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    ```

    Because listeners are managed using an internal array, calling this will change the position indices of any listener registered *after* the listener being removed. This will not impact the order in which listeners are called, but it means that any copies of the listener array as returned by the `emitter.listeners()` method will need to be recreated.

    When a single function has been added as a handler multiple times for a single event (as in the example below), `removeListener()` will remove the most recently added instance. In the example the `once('ping')` listener is removed:

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const ee = new EventEmitter();

    function pong() {
      console.log('pong');
    }

    ee.on('ping', pong);
    ee.once('ping', pong);
    ee.removeListener('ping', pong);

    ee.emit('ping');
    ee.emit('ping');
    ```

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

    @param encoding

    The new default encoding
  + [setMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Sign/setMaxListeners)(

    n: number

    ): this;

    By default `EventEmitter`s will print a warning if more than `10` listeners are added for a particular event. This is a useful default that helps finding memory leaks. The `emitter.setMaxListeners()` method allows the limit to be modified for this specific `EventEmitter` instance. The value can be set to `Infinity` (or `0`) to indicate an unlimited number of listeners.

    ): NonSharedBuffer;

    Calculates the signature on all the data passed through using either `sign.update()` or `sign.write()`.

    If `privateKey` is not a `KeyObject`, this function behaves as if `privateKey` had been passed to createPrivateKey. If it is an object, the following additional properties can be passed:

    If `outputEncoding` is provided a string is returned; otherwise a `Buffer` is returned.

    The `Sign` object can not be again used after `sign.sign()` method has been called. Multiple calls to `sign.sign()` will result in an error being thrown.

    The `Sign` object can not be again used after `sign.sign()` method has been called. Multiple calls to `sign.sign()` will result in an error being thrown.
  + [uncork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Sign/uncork)(): void;

    The `writable.uncork()` method flushes all data buffered since cork was called.

    When using `writable.cork()` and `writable.uncork()` to manage the buffering of writes to a stream, defer calls to `writable.uncork()` using `process.nextTick()`. Doing so allows batching of all `writable.write()` calls that occur within a given Node.js event loop phase.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => stream.uncork());
    ```

    If the `writable.cork()` method is called multiple times on a stream, the same number of calls to `writable.uncork()` must be called to flush the buffered data.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => {
      stream.uncork();
      // The data will not be flushed until uncork() is called a second time.
      stream.uncork();
    });
    ```

    ): this;

    Updates the `Sign` content with the given `data`, the encoding of which is given in `inputEncoding`. If `encoding` is not provided, and the `data` is a string, an encoding of `'utf8'` is enforced. If `data` is a `Buffer`, `TypedArray`, or`DataView`, then `inputEncoding` is ignored.

    This can be called many times with new data as it is streamed.

  + [write](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Sign/write)(

    chunk: any,

    callback?: (error: undefined | null | [Error](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Error)) => void

    ): boolean;

    The `writable.write()` method writes some data to the stream, and calls the supplied `callback` once the data has been fully handled. If an error occurs, the `callback` will be called with the error as its first argument. The `callback` is called asynchronously and before `'error'` is emitted.

    The return value is `true` if the internal buffer is less than the `highWaterMark` configured when the stream was created after admitting `chunk`. If `false` is returned, further attempts to write data to the stream should stop until the `'drain'` event is emitted.

    While a stream is not draining, calls to `write()` will buffer `chunk`, and return false. Once all currently buffered chunks are drained (accepted for delivery by the operating system), the `'drain'` event will be emitted. Once `write()` returns false, do not write more chunks until the `'drain'` event is emitted. While calling `write()` on a stream that is not draining is allowed, Node.js will buffer all written chunks until maximum memory usage occurs, at which point it will abort unconditionally. Even before it aborts, high memory usage will cause poor garbage collector performance and high RSS (which is not typically released back to the system, even after the memory is no longer required). Since TCP sockets may never drain if the remote peer does not read the data, writing a socket that is not draining may lead to a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

    Writing data while the stream is not draining is particularly problematic for a `Transform`, because the `Transform` streams are paused by default until they are piped or a `'data'` or `'readable'` event handler is added.

    If the data to be written can be generated or fetched on demand, it is recommended to encapsulate the logic into a `Readable` and use pipe. However, if calling `write()` is preferred, it is possible to respect backpressure and avoid memory issues using the `'drain'` event:

    ```
    function write(data, cb) {
      if (!stream.write(data)) {
        stream.once('drain', cb);
      } else {
        process.nextTick(cb);
      }
    }

    // Wait for cb to be called before doing any other write.
    write('hello', () => {
      console.log('Write completed, do more writes now.');
    });
    ```

    A `Writable` stream in object mode will always ignore the `encoding` argument.

    @param chunk

    Optional data to write. For streams not operating in object mode, `chunk` must be a {string}, {Buffer}, {TypedArray} or {DataView}. For object mode streams, `chunk` may be any JavaScript value other than `null`.

    @param callback

    Callback for when this chunk of data is flushed.

    @returns

    `false` if the stream wishes for the calling code to wait for the `'drain'` event to be emitted before continuing to write additional data; otherwise `true`.

    resource: (event: [Event](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Event)) => void

    ): Disposable;

    Listens once to the `abort` event on the provided `signal`.

    Listening to the `abort` event on abort signals is unsafe and may lead to resource leaks since another third party with the signal can call `e.stopImmediatePropagation()`. Unfortunately Node.js cannot change this since it would violate the web standard. Additionally, the original API makes it easy to forget to remove listeners.

    This API allows safely using `AbortSignal`s in Node.js APIs by solving these two issues by listening to the event such that `stopImmediatePropagation` does not prevent the listener from running.

    Returns a disposable so that it may be unsubscribed from more easily.

    ```
    import { addAbortListener } from 'node:events';

    function example(signal) {
      let disposable;

    For `EventTarget`s this is the only way to get the max event listeners for the event target. If the number of event handlers on a single EventTarget exceeds the max set, the EventTarget will print a warning.

    ```
    import { getMaxListeners, setMaxListeners, EventEmitter } from 'node:events';

    {
      const ee = new EventEmitter();
      console.log(getMaxListeners(ee)); // 10
      setMaxListeners(11, ee);
      console.log(getMaxListeners(ee)); // 11
    }
    {
      const et = new EventTarget();
      console.log(getMaxListeners(et)); // 10
      setMaxListeners(11, et);

  The `Verify` class is a utility for verifying signatures. It can be used in one of two ways:

  + As a writable `stream` where written data is used to validate against the supplied signature, or
  + Using the `verify.update()` and `verify.verify()` methods to verify the signature.

  The createVerify method is used to create `Verify` instances. `Verify` objects are not to be created directly using the `new` keyword.

  See `Sign` for examples.

  + readonly [closed](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Verify/closed): boolean

    Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
  + [destroyed](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Verify/destroyed): boolean

    Is `true` after `writable.destroy()` has been called.
  + readonly [errored](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Verify/errored): null | [Error](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Error)

    Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
  + readonly [writable](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Verify/writable): boolean

    Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
  + readonly [writableAborted](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Verify/writableAborted): boolean

    Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'finish'`.
  + readonly [writableCorked](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Verify/writableCorked): number

    Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
  + readonly [writableEnded](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Verify/writableEnded): boolean

    Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.

    Is set to `true` immediately before the `'finish'` event is emitted.

    Return the value of `highWaterMark` passed when creating this `Writable`.
  + readonly [writableLength](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Verify/writableLength): number

    This property contains the number of bytes (or objects) in the queue ready to be written. The value provides introspection data regarding the status of the `highWaterMark`.

    Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Writable` stream.
  + static [captureRejections](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Verify/captureRejections): boolean

    Value: `Symbol.for('nodejs.rejection')`

    See how to write a custom `rejection handler`.
  + static [defaultMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Verify/defaultMaxListeners): number

    By default, a maximum of `10` listeners can be registered for any single event. This limit can be changed for individual `EventEmitter` instances using the `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` method. To change the default for *all*`EventEmitter` instances, the `events.defaultMaxListeners` property can be used. If this value is not a positive number, a `RangeError` is thrown.

    Take caution when setting the `events.defaultMaxListeners` because the change affects *all* `EventEmitter` instances, including those created before the change is made. However, calling `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` still has precedence over `events.defaultMaxListeners`.

    This is not a hard limit. The `EventEmitter` instance will allow more listeners to be added but will output a trace warning to stderr indicating that a "possible EventEmitter memory leak" has been detected. For any single `EventEmitter`, the `emitter.getMaxListeners()` and `emitter.setMaxListeners()` methods can be used to temporarily avoid this warning:

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const emitter = new EventEmitter();
    emitter.setMaxListeners(emitter.getMaxListeners() + 1);
    emitter.once('event', () => {
      // do stuff
      emitter.setMaxListeners(Math.max(emitter.getMaxListeners() - 1, 0));
    });
    ```

    The `--trace-warnings` command-line flag can be used to display the stack trace for such warnings.

    The emitted warning can be inspected with `process.on('warning')` and will have the additional `emitter`, `type`, and `count` properties, referring to the event emitter instance, the event's name and the number of attached listeners, respectively. Its `name` property is set to `'MaxListenersExceededWarning'`.
  + readonly static [errorMonitor](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Verify/errorMonitor): typeof [errorMonitor](https://bun.com/reference/node/events/default/errorMonitor)

    This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'` events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular `'error'` listeners are called.

    Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an `'error'` event is emitted. Therefore, the process will still crash if no regular `'error'` listener is installed.

  + [cork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Verify/cork)(): void;

    The `writable.cork()` method forces all written data to be buffered in memory. The buffered data will be flushed when either the uncork or end methods are called.

    The primary intent of `writable.cork()` is to accommodate a situation in which several small chunks are written to the stream in rapid succession. Instead of immediately forwarding them to the underlying destination, `writable.cork()` buffers all the chunks until `writable.uncork()` is called, which will pass them all to `writable._writev()`, if present. This prevents a head-of-line blocking situation where data is being buffered while waiting for the first small chunk to be processed. However, use of `writable.cork()` without implementing `writable._writev()` may have an adverse effect on throughput.

    See also: `writable.uncork()`, `writable._writev()`.
  + [destroy](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Verify/destroy)(

    error?: [Error](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Error)

    ): this;

    Destroy the stream. Optionally emit an `'error'` event, and emit a `'close'` event (unless `emitClose` is set to `false`). After this call, the writable stream has ended and subsequent calls to `write()` or `end()` will result in an `ERR_STREAM_DESTROYED` error. This is a destructive and immediate way to destroy a stream. Previous calls to `write()` may not have drained, and may trigger an `ERR_STREAM_DESTROYED` error. Use `end()` instead of destroy if data should flush before close, or wait for the `'drain'` event before destroying the stream.

    Once `destroy()` has been called any further calls will be a no-op and no further errors except from `_destroy()` may be emitted as `'error'`.

    Implementors should not override this method, but instead implement `writable._destroy()`.

    Optional, an error to emit with `'error'` event.

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';

    ```
  + [removeAllListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Verify/removeAllListeners)(

    eventName?: string | symbol

    ): this;

    Removes all listeners, or those of the specified `eventName`.

    It is bad practice to remove listeners added elsewhere in the code, particularly when the `EventEmitter` instance was created by some other component or module (e.g. sockets or file streams).

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [removeListener](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Verify/removeListener)(

    event: 'close',

    listener: () => void

    ): this;

    Removes the specified `listener` from the listener array for the event named `eventName`.

    ```
    const callback = (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    };
    server.on('connection', callback);
    // ...
    server.removeListener('connection', callback);
    ```

    `removeListener()` will remove, at most, one instance of a listener from the listener array. If any single listener has been added multiple times to the listener array for the specified `eventName`, then `removeListener()` must be called multiple times to remove each instance.

    Once an event is emitted, all listeners attached to it at the time of emitting are called in order. This implies that any `removeListener()` or `removeAllListeners()` calls *after* emitting and *before* the last listener finishes execution will not remove them from`emit()` in progress. Subsequent events behave as expected.

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}
    const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

    const callbackA = () => {
      console.log('A');
      myEmitter.removeListener('event', callbackB);
    };

    const callbackB = () => {
      console.log('B');
    };

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackA);

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackB);

    // callbackA removes listener callbackB but it will still be called.
    // Internal listener array at time of emit [callbackA, callbackB]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    //   B

    // callbackB is now removed.
    // Internal listener array [callbackA]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    ```

    Because listeners are managed using an internal array, calling this will change the position indices of any listener registered *after* the listener being removed. This will not impact the order in which listeners are called, but it means that any copies of the listener array as returned by the `emitter.listeners()` method will need to be recreated.

    When a single function has been added as a handler multiple times for a single event (as in the example below), `removeListener()` will remove the most recently added instance. In the example the `once('ping')` listener is removed:

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const ee = new EventEmitter();

    function pong() {
      console.log('pong');
    }

    ee.on('ping', pong);
    ee.once('ping', pong);
    ee.removeListener('ping', pong);

    ee.emit('ping');
    ee.emit('ping');
    ```

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

    @param encoding

    The new default encoding
  + [setMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Verify/setMaxListeners)(

    n: number

    ): this;

    By default `EventEmitter`s will print a warning if more than `10` listeners are added for a particular event. This is a useful default that helps finding memory leaks. The `emitter.setMaxListeners()` method allows the limit to be modified for this specific `EventEmitter` instance. The value can be set to `Infinity` (or `0`) to indicate an unlimited number of listeners.

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [uncork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Verify/uncork)(): void;

    The `writable.uncork()` method flushes all data buffered since cork was called.

    When using `writable.cork()` and `writable.uncork()` to manage the buffering of writes to a stream, defer calls to `writable.uncork()` using `process.nextTick()`. Doing so allows batching of all `writable.write()` calls that occur within a given Node.js event loop phase.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => stream.uncork());
    ```

    If the `writable.cork()` method is called multiple times on a stream, the same number of calls to `writable.uncork()` must be called to flush the buffered data.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => {
      stream.uncork();
      // The data will not be flushed until uncork() is called a second time.
      stream.uncork();
    });
    ```

    The `writable.write()` method writes some data to the stream, and calls the supplied `callback` once the data has been fully handled. If an error occurs, the `callback` will be called with the error as its first argument. The `callback` is called asynchronously and before `'error'` is emitted.

    The return value is `true` if the internal buffer is less than the `highWaterMark` configured when the stream was created after admitting `chunk`. If `false` is returned, further attempts to write data to the stream should stop until the `'drain'` event is emitted.

    While a stream is not draining, calls to `write()` will buffer `chunk`, and return false. Once all currently buffered chunks are drained (accepted for delivery by the operating system), the `'drain'` event will be emitted. Once `write()` returns false, do not write more chunks until the `'drain'` event is emitted. While calling `write()` on a stream that is not draining is allowed, Node.js will buffer all written chunks until maximum memory usage occurs, at which point it will abort unconditionally. Even before it aborts, high memory usage will cause poor garbage collector performance and high RSS (which is not typically released back to the system, even after the memory is no longer required). Since TCP sockets may never drain if the remote peer does not read the data, writing a socket that is not draining may lead to a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

    Writing data while the stream is not draining is particularly problematic for a `Transform`, because the `Transform` streams are paused by default until they are piped or a `'data'` or `'readable'` event handler is added.

    If the data to be written can be generated or fetched on demand, it is recommended to encapsulate the logic into a `Readable` and use pipe. However, if calling `write()` is preferred, it is possible to respect backpressure and avoid memory issues using the `'drain'` event:

    ```
    function write(data, cb) {
      if (!stream.write(data)) {
        stream.once('drain', cb);
      } else {
        process.nextTick(cb);
      }
    }

    // Wait for cb to be called before doing any other write.
    write('hello', () => {
      console.log('Write completed, do more writes now.');
    });
    ```

    @returns

    signal: [AbortSignal](https://bun.com/reference/globals/AbortSignal),

    resource: (event: [Event](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Event)) => void

    ): Disposable;

    Listens once to the `abort` event on the provided `signal`.

    Listening to the `abort` event on abort signals is unsafe and may lead to resource leaks since another third party with the signal can call `e.stopImmediatePropagation()`. Unfortunately Node.js cannot change this since it would violate the web standard. Additionally, the original API makes it easy to forget to remove listeners.

    This API allows safely using `AbortSignal`s in Node.js APIs by solving these two issues by listening to the event such that `stopImmediatePropagation` does not prevent the listener from running.

    Returns a disposable so that it may be unsubscribed from more easily.

    ```
    import { addAbortListener } from 'node:events';

    function example(signal) {
      let disposable;
      try {
        signal.addEventListener('abort', (e) => e.stopImmediatePropagation());
        disposable = addAbortListener(signal, (e) => {

        });
      } finally {
        disposable?.[Symbol.dispose]();
      }

    For `EventEmitter`s this behaves exactly the same as calling `.listeners` on the emitter.

    For `EventTarget`s this is the only way to get the event listeners for the event target. This is useful for debugging and diagnostic purposes.

    For `EventTarget`s this is the only way to get the max event listeners for the event target. If the number of event handlers on a single EventTarget exceeds the max set, the EventTarget will print a warning.

    Returns an `AsyncIterator` that iterates `eventName` events. It will throw if the `EventEmitter` emits `'error'`. It removes all listeners when exiting the loop. The `value` returned by each iteration is an array composed of the emitted event arguments.

    An `AbortSignal` can be used to cancel waiting on events:

    This is a comma-separated list of subject alternative names. Each entry begins with a string identifying the kind of the subject alternative name followed by a colon and the value associated with the entry.

    Earlier versions of Node.js incorrectly assumed that it is safe to split this property at the two-character sequence `', '` (see [CVE-2021-44532](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44532)). However, both malicious and legitimate certificates can contain subject alternative names that include this sequence when represented as a string.

    After the prefix denoting the type of the entry, the remainder of each entry might be enclosed in quotes to indicate that the value is a JSON string literal. For backward compatibility, Node.js only uses JSON string literals within this property when necessary to avoid ambiguity. Third-party code should be prepared to handle both possible entry formats.
  + readonly [validFrom](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/X509Certificate/validFrom): string

    The date/time from which this certificate is considered valid.
  + readonly [validFromDate](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/X509Certificate/validFromDate): Date

    The date/time from which this certificate is valid, encapsulated in a `Date` object.
  + readonly [validTo](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/X509Certificate/validTo): string

    The date/time until which this certificate is considered valid.
  + readonly [validToDate](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/X509Certificate/validToDate): Date

    The date/time until which this certificate is valid, encapsulated in a `Date` object.
  + [checkEmail](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/X509Certificate/checkEmail)(

    email: string,

    options?: Pick<[X509CheckOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/X509CheckOptions), 'subject'>

    ): undefined | string;

    Checks whether the certificate matches the given email address.

    If the `'subject'` option is undefined or set to `'default'`, the certificate subject is only considered if the subject alternative name extension either does not exist or does not contain any email addresses.

    If the `'subject'` option is set to `'always'` and if the subject alternative name extension either does not exist or does not contain a matching email address, the certificate subject is considered.

    If the `'subject'` option is set to `'never'`, the certificate subject is never considered, even if the certificate contains no subject alternative names.

    @returns

    Returns `email` if the certificate matches, `undefined` if it does not.
  + [checkHost](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/X509Certificate/checkHost)(

    name: string,

    options?: [X509CheckOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/X509CheckOptions)

    ): undefined | string;

    Checks whether the certificate matches the given host name.

    If the certificate matches the given host name, the matching subject name is returned. The returned name might be an exact match (e.g., `foo.example.com`) or it might contain wildcards (e.g., `*.example.com`). Because host name comparisons are case-insensitive, the returned subject name might also differ from the given `name` in capitalization.

    If the `'subject'` option is undefined or set to `'default'`, the certificate subject is only considered if the subject alternative name extension either does not exist or does not contain any DNS names. This behavior is consistent with [RFC 2818](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt) ("HTTP Over TLS").

    If the `'subject'` option is set to `'always'` and if the subject alternative name extension either does not exist or does not contain a matching DNS name, the certificate subject is considered.

    If the `'subject'` option is set to `'never'`, the certificate subject is never considered, even if the certificate contains no subject alternative names.

    @returns

    Returns a subject name that matches `name`, or `undefined` if no subject name matches `name`.
  + [checkIP](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/X509Certificate/checkIP)(

    ip: string

    ): undefined | string;

    Checks whether the certificate matches the given IP address (IPv4 or IPv6).

    Only [RFC 5280](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5280.txt) `iPAddress` subject alternative names are considered, and they must match the given `ip` address exactly. Other subject alternative names as well as the subject field of the certificate are ignored.

    @returns

    Returns `ip` if the certificate matches, `undefined` if it does not.
  + [checkIssued](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/X509Certificate/checkIssued)(

    otherCert: [X509Certificate](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/X509Certificate)

    ): boolean;

    Checks whether this certificate was potentially issued by the given `otherCert` by comparing the certificate metadata.

    This is useful for pruning a list of possible issuer certificates which have been selected using a more rudimentary filtering routine, i.e. just based on subject and issuer names.

    Finally, to verify that this certificate's signature was produced by a private key corresponding to `otherCert`'s public key use `x509.verify(publicKey)` with `otherCert`'s public key represented as a `KeyObject` like so

    ```
    if (!x509.verify(otherCert.publicKey)) {
      throw new Error('otherCert did not issue x509');
    }
    ```
  + [checkPrivateKey](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/X509Certificate/checkPrivateKey)(

    privateKey: [KeyObject](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/KeyObject)

    ): boolean;

    Checks whether the public key for this certificate is consistent with the given private key.

    @param privateKey

    A private key.
  + [toJSON](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/X509Certificate/toJSON)(): string;

    There is no standard JSON encoding for X509 certificates. The`toJSON()` method returns a string containing the PEM encoded certificate.
  + [toLegacyObject](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/X509Certificate/toLegacyObject)(): [PeerCertificate](https://bun.com/reference/node/tls/PeerCertificate);

    Returns information about this certificate using the legacy `certificate object` encoding.
  + [toString](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/X509Certificate/toString)(): string;

    Returns the PEM-encoded certificate.
  + [verify](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/X509Certificate/verify)(

    publicKey: [KeyObject](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/KeyObject)

    ): boolean;

    Verifies that this certificate was signed by the given public key. Does not perform any other validation checks on the certificate.

    @param publicKey

    A public key.
* const [DiffieHellmanGroup](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DiffieHellmanGroup): [DiffieHellmanGroupConstructor](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DiffieHellmanGroupConstructor)

  The `DiffieHellmanGroup` class takes a well-known modp group as its argument. It works the same as `DiffieHellman`, except that it does not allow changing its keys after creation. In other words, it does not implement `setPublicKey()` or `setPrivateKey()` methods.

  ```
  const { createDiffieHellmanGroup } = await import('node:crypto');
  const dh = createDiffieHellmanGroup('modp1');
  ```

  The name (e.g. `'modp1'`) is taken from [RFC 2412](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2412.txt) (modp1 and 2) and [RFC 3526](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3526.txt):

  ```
  perl -ne 'print "$1\n" if /"(modp\d+)"/' src/node_crypto_groups.h
  ```

  ```
  modp1  #  768 bits
  modp2  # 1024 bits
  modp5  # 1536 bits
  modp14 # 2048 bits
  modp15 # etc.

  The `callback` function is called with two arguments: `err` and `derivedKey`. `err` is an exception object when key derivation fails, otherwise `err` is `null`. `derivedKey` is passed to the callback as a `Buffer`.

  An exception is thrown when any of the input arguments specify invalid values or types.

  options: [CipherCCMOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCMOptions)

  ): [CipherCCM](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM);

  Creates and returns a `Cipher` object, with the given `algorithm`, `key` and initialization vector (`iv`).

  The `options` argument controls stream behavior and is optional except when a cipher in CCM or OCB mode (e.g. `'aes-128-ccm'`) is used. In that case, the`authTagLength` option is required and specifies the length of the authentication tag in bytes, see `CCM mode`. In GCM mode, the `authTagLength`option is not required but can be used to set the length of the authentication tag that will be returned by `getAuthTag()` and defaults to 16 bytes. For `chacha20-poly1305`, the `authTagLength` option defaults to 16 bytes.

  The `algorithm` is dependent on OpenSSL, examples are `'aes192'`, etc. On recent OpenSSL releases, `openssl list -cipher-algorithms` will display the available cipher algorithms.

  The `key` is the raw key used by the `algorithm` and `iv` is an [initialization vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector). Both arguments must be `'utf8'` encoded strings,`Buffers`, `TypedArray`, or `DataView`s. The `key` may optionally be a `KeyObject` of type `secret`. If the cipher does not need an initialization vector, `iv` may be `null`.

  When passing strings for `key` or `iv`, please consider `caveats when using strings as inputs to cryptographic APIs`.

  Initialization vectors should be unpredictable and unique; ideally, they will be cryptographically random. They do not have to be secret: IVs are typically just added to ciphertext messages unencrypted. It may sound contradictory that something has to be unpredictable and unique, but does not have to be secret; remember that an attacker must not be able to predict ahead of time what a given IV will be.

  options?: [CipherGCMOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherGCMOptions)

  ): [DecipherGCM](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM);

  Creates and returns a `Decipheriv` object that uses the given `algorithm`, `key` and initialization vector (`iv`).

  The `options` argument controls stream behavior and is optional except when a cipher in CCM or OCB mode (e.g. `'aes-128-ccm'`) is used. In that case, the `authTagLength` option is required and specifies the length of the authentication tag in bytes, see `CCM mode`. In GCM mode, the `authTagLength` option is not required but can be used to restrict accepted authentication tags to those with the specified length. For `chacha20-poly1305`, the `authTagLength` option defaults to 16 bytes.

  The `algorithm` is dependent on OpenSSL, examples are `'aes192'`, etc. On recent OpenSSL releases, `openssl list -cipher-algorithms` will display the available cipher algorithms.

  The `key` is the raw key used by the `algorithm` and `iv` is an [initialization vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector). Both arguments must be `'utf8'` encoded strings,`Buffers`, `TypedArray`, or `DataView`s. The `key` may optionally be a `KeyObject` of type `secret`. If the cipher does not need an initialization vector, `iv` may be `null`.

  When passing strings for `key` or `iv`, please consider `caveats when using strings as inputs to cryptographic APIs`.

  Initialization vectors should be unpredictable and unique; ideally, they will be cryptographically random. They do not have to be secret: IVs are typically just added to ciphertext messages unencrypted. It may sound contradictory that something has to be unpredictable and unique, but does not have to be secret; remember that an attacker must not be able to predict ahead of time what a given IV will be.

  Creates and returns a `Hash` object that can be used to generate hash digests using the given `algorithm`. Optional `options` argument controls stream behavior. For XOF hash functions such as `'shake256'`, the `outputLength` option can be used to specify the desired output length in bytes.

  The `algorithm` is dependent on the available algorithms supported by the version of OpenSSL on the platform. Examples are `'sha256'`, `'sha512'`, etc. On recent releases of OpenSSL, `openssl list -digest-algorithms` will display the available digest algorithms.

  ): Hmac;

  Creates and returns an `Hmac` object that uses the given `algorithm` and `key`. Optional `options` argument controls stream behavior.

  The `algorithm` is dependent on the available algorithms supported by the version of OpenSSL on the platform. Examples are `'sha256'`, `'sha512'`, etc. On recent releases of OpenSSL, `openssl list -digest-algorithms` will display the available digest algorithms.

  The `key` is the HMAC key used to generate the cryptographic HMAC hash. If it is a `KeyObject`, its type must be `secret`. If it is a string, please consider `caveats when using strings as inputs to cryptographic APIs`. If it was obtained from a cryptographically secure source of entropy, such as randomBytes or generateKey, its length should not exceed the block size of `algorithm` (e.g., 512 bits for SHA-256).

  Example: generating the sha256 HMAC of a file

  ): [KeyObject](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/KeyObject);

  Creates and returns a new key object containing a private key. If `key` is a string or `Buffer`, `format` is assumed to be `'pem'`; otherwise, `key` must be an object with the properties described above.

  If the private key is encrypted, a `passphrase` must be specified. The length of the passphrase is limited to 1024 bytes.
* function [createPublicKey](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/createPublicKey)(

  ): [KeyObject](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/KeyObject);

  Creates and returns a new key object containing a public key. If `key` is a string or `Buffer`, `format` is assumed to be `'pem'`; if `key` is a `KeyObject` with type `'private'`, the public key is derived from the given private key; otherwise, `key` must be an object with the properties described above.

  If the format is `'pem'`, the `'key'` may also be an X.509 certificate.

  Because public keys can be derived from private keys, a private key may be passed instead of a public key. In that case, this function behaves as if createPrivateKey had been called, except that the type of the returned `KeyObject` will be `'public'` and that the private key cannot be extracted from the returned `KeyObject`. Similarly, if a `KeyObject` with type `'private'` is given, a new `KeyObject` with type `'public'` will be returned and it will be impossible to extract the private key from the returned object.
* function [createSecretKey](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/createSecretKey)(

  ): [Sign](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/Sign);

  Creates and returns a `Sign` object that uses the given `algorithm`. Use getHashes to obtain the names of the available digest algorithms. Optional `options` argument controls the `stream.Writable` behavior.

  In some cases, a `Sign` instance can be created using the name of a signature algorithm, such as `'RSA-SHA256'`, instead of a digest algorithm. This will use the corresponding digest algorithm. This does not work for all signature algorithms, such as `'ecdsa-with-SHA256'`, so it is best to always use digest algorithm names.

  Creates and returns a `Verify` object that uses the given algorithm. Use getHashes to obtain an array of names of the available signing algorithms. Optional `options` argument controls the `stream.Writable` behavior.

  In some cases, a `Verify` instance can be created using the name of a signature algorithm, such as `'RSA-SHA256'`, instead of a digest algorithm. This will use the corresponding digest algorithm.

  ): void;

  Generates a new asymmetric key pair of the given `type`. RSA, RSA-PSS, DSA, EC, Ed25519, Ed448, X25519, X448, and DH are currently supported.

  If a `publicKeyEncoding` or `privateKeyEncoding` was specified, this function behaves as if `keyObject.export()` had been called on its result. Otherwise, the respective part of the key is returned as a `KeyObject`.

  It is recommended to encode public keys as `'spki'` and private keys as `'pkcs8'` with encryption for long-term storage:

  ```
  const {
    generateKeyPair,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  generateKeyPair('rsa', {
    modulusLength: 4096,
    publicKeyEncoding: {
      type: 'spki',
      format: 'pem',
    },
    privateKeyEncoding: {
      type: 'pkcs8',
      format: 'pem',
      cipher: 'aes-256-cbc',
      passphrase: 'top secret',
    },
  }, (err, publicKey, privateKey) => {
    // Handle errors and use the generated key pair.
  });
  ```

  On completion, `callback` will be called with `err` set to `undefined` and `publicKey` / `privateKey` representing the generated key pair.

  If this method is invoked as its `util.promisify()` ed version, it returns a `Promise` for an `Object` with `publicKey` and `privateKey` properties.

  When encoding public keys, it is recommended to use `'spki'`. When encoding private keys, it is recommended to use `'pkcs8'` with a strong passphrase, and to keep the passphrase confidential.

  When encoding public keys, it is recommended to use `'spki'`. When encoding private keys, it is recommended to use `'pkcs8'` with a strong passphrase, and to keep the passphrase confidential.

  ```
  const {
    generateKeyPairSync,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const {
    publicKey,
    privateKey,
  } = generateKeyPairSync('rsa', {
    modulusLength: 4096,

  ```

  The return value `{ publicKey, privateKey }` represents the generated key pair. When PEM encoding was selected, the respective key will be a string, otherwise it will be a buffer containing the data encoded as DER.

  The size of a generated HMAC key should not exceed the block size of the underlying hash function. See createHmac for more information.

  @param type

  The intended use of the generated secret key. Currently accepted values are `'hmac'` and `'aes'`.

  The returned object mimics the interface of objects created by createDiffieHellman, but will not allow changing the keys (with `diffieHellman.setPublicKey()`, for example). The advantage of using this method is that the parties do not have to generate nor exchange a group modulus beforehand, saving both processor and communication time.

  Example (obtaining a shared secret):

  ```
  const {
    getDiffieHellman,
  } = await import('node:crypto');
  const alice = getDiffieHellman('modp14');
  const bob = getDiffieHellman('modp14');

  alice.generateKeys();
  bob.generateKeys();

  const aliceSecret = alice.computeSecret(bob.getPublicKey(), null, 'hex');

  Provides an asynchronous Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) implementation. A selected HMAC digest algorithm specified by `digest` is applied to derive a key of the requested byte length (`keylen`) from the `password`, `salt` and `iterations`.

  The supplied `callback` function is called with two arguments: `err` and `derivedKey`. If an error occurs while deriving the key, `err` will be set; otherwise `err` will be `null`. By default, the successfully generated `derivedKey` will be passed to the callback as a `Buffer`. An error will be thrown if any of the input arguments specify invalid values or types.

  The `iterations` argument must be a number set as high as possible. The higher the number of iterations, the more secure the derived key will be, but will take a longer amount of time to complete.

  The `salt` should be as unique as possible. It is recommended that a salt is random and at least 16 bytes long. See [NIST SP 800-132](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-132.pdf) for details.

  When passing strings for `password` or `salt`, please consider `caveats when using strings as inputs to cryptographic APIs`.

  Decrypts `buffer` with `privateKey`. `buffer` was previously encrypted using the corresponding public key, for example using publicEncrypt.

* function [randomBytes](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/randomBytes)(

  size: number

  ): NonSharedBuffer;

  Generates cryptographically strong pseudorandom data. The `size` argument is a number indicating the number of bytes to generate.

  If a `callback` function is provided, the bytes are generated asynchronously and the `callback` function is invoked with two arguments: `err` and `buf`. If an error occurs, `err` will be an `Error` object; otherwise it is `null`. The `buf` argument is a `Buffer` containing the generated bytes.

  ```
  // Asynchronous
  const {
    randomBytes,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  randomBytes(256, (err, buf) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(`${buf.length} bytes of random data: ${buf.toString('hex')}`);
  });
  ```

  If the `callback` function is not provided, the random bytes are generated synchronously and returned as a `Buffer`. An error will be thrown if there is a problem generating the bytes.

  ```
  // Synchronous
  const {
    randomBytes,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const buf = randomBytes(256);
  console.log(
    `${buf.length} bytes of random data: ${buf.toString('hex')}`);
  ```

  The `crypto.randomBytes()` method will not complete until there is sufficient entropy available. This should normally never take longer than a few milliseconds. The only time when generating the random bytes may conceivably block for a longer period of time is right after boot, when the whole system is still low on entropy.

  This API uses libuv's threadpool, which can have surprising and negative performance implications for some applications; see the `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` documentation for more information.

  The asynchronous version of `crypto.randomBytes()` is carried out in a single threadpool request. To minimize threadpool task length variation, partition large `randomBytes` requests when doing so as part of fulfilling a client request.

  @param size

  The number of bytes to generate. The `size` must not be larger than `2**31 - 1`.

  Any `ArrayBuffer`, `TypedArray`, or `DataView` instance may be passed as `buffer`.

  While this includes instances of `Float32Array` and `Float64Array`, this function should not be used to generate random floating-point numbers. The result may contain `+Infinity`, `-Infinity`, and `NaN`, and even if the array contains finite numbers only, they are not drawn from a uniform random distribution and have no meaningful lower or upper bounds.

  Provides an asynchronous [scrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt) implementation. Scrypt is a password-based key derivation function that is designed to be expensive computationally and memory-wise in order to make brute-force attacks unrewarding.

  The `salt` should be as unique as possible. It is recommended that a salt is random and at least 16 bytes long. See [NIST SP 800-132](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-132.pdf) for details.

  When passing strings for `password` or `salt`, please consider `caveats when using strings as inputs to cryptographic APIs`.

  The `callback` function is called with two arguments: `err` and `derivedKey`. `err` is an exception object when key derivation fails, otherwise `err` is `null`. `derivedKey` is passed to the callback as a `Buffer`.

  An exception is thrown when any of the input arguments specify invalid values or types.

* function [timingSafeEqual](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/timingSafeEqual)(

  a: ArrayBufferView,

  ): boolean;

  This function compares the underlying bytes that represent the given `ArrayBuffer`, `TypedArray`, or `DataView` instances using a constant-time algorithm.

  This function does not leak timing information that would allow an attacker to guess one of the values. This is suitable for comparing HMAC digests or secret values like authentication cookies or [capability urls](https://www.w3.org/TR/capability-urls/).

  `a` and `b` must both be `Buffer`s, `TypedArray`s, or `DataView`s, and they must have the same byte length. An error is thrown if `a` and `b` have different byte lengths.

  If at least one of `a` and `b` is a `TypedArray` with more than one byte per entry, such as `Uint16Array`, the result will be computed using the platform byte order.

  **When both of the inputs are `Float32Array`s or `Float64Array`s, this function might return unexpected results due to IEEE 754** **encoding of floating-point numbers. In particular, neither `x === y` nor `Object.is(x, y)` implies that the byte representations of two floating-point** **numbers `x` and `y` are equal.**

  Use of `crypto.timingSafeEqual` does not guarantee that the *surrounding* code is timing-safe. Care should be taken to ensure that the surrounding code does not introduce timing vulnerabilities.

  ): void;

  Generates a new asymmetric key pair of the given `type`. RSA, RSA-PSS, DSA, EC, Ed25519, Ed448, X25519, X448, and DH are currently supported.

  If a `publicKeyEncoding` or `privateKeyEncoding` was specified, this function behaves as if `keyObject.export()` had been called on its result. Otherwise, the respective part of the key is returned as a `KeyObject`.

  It is recommended to encode public keys as `'spki'` and private keys as `'pkcs8'` with encryption for long-term storage:

  ```
  const {

  });
  ```

  On completion, `callback` will be called with `err` set to `undefined` and `publicKey` / `privateKey` representing the generated key pair.

  Generates a new asymmetric key pair of the given `type`. RSA, RSA-PSS, DSA, EC, Ed25519, Ed448, X25519, X448, and DH are currently supported.

  If a `publicKeyEncoding` or `privateKeyEncoding` was specified, this function behaves as if `keyObject.export()` had been called on its result. Otherwise, the respective part of the key is returned as a `KeyObject`.

  It is recommended to encode public keys as `'spki'` and private keys as `'pkcs8'` with encryption for long-term storage:

  ```

  ```

  On completion, `callback` will be called with `err` set to `undefined` and `publicKey` / `privateKey` representing the generated key pair.

* ### interface [CipherCCM](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM)

  Instances of the `Cipheriv` class are used to encrypt data. The class can be used in one of two ways:

  + As a `stream` that is both readable and writable, where plain unencrypted data is written to produce encrypted data on the readable side, or
  + Using the `cipher.update()` and `cipher.final()` methods to produce the encrypted data.

  The createCipheriv method is used to create `Cipheriv` instances. `Cipheriv` objects are not to be created directly using the `new` keyword.

  Example: Using `Cipheriv` objects as streams:

  ```
  const {
    scrypt,
    randomFill,
    createCipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';

  // First, we'll generate the key. The key length is dependent on the algorithm.
  // In this case for aes192, it is 24 bytes (192 bits).
  scrypt(password, 'salt', 24, (err, key) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    // Then, we'll generate a random initialization vector
    randomFill(new Uint8Array(16), (err, iv) => {
      if (err) throw err;

      // Once we have the key and iv, we can create and use the cipher...
      const cipher = createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

      let encrypted = '';
      cipher.setEncoding('hex');

      cipher.on('data', (chunk) => encrypted += chunk);
      cipher.on('end', () => console.log(encrypted));

      cipher.write('some clear text data');
      cipher.end();
    });
  });
  ```

  Example: Using `Cipheriv` and piped streams:

  ```
  import {
    createReadStream,
    createWriteStream,
  } from 'node:fs';

  import {
    pipeline,
  } from 'node:stream';

  const {
    scrypt,
    randomFill,
    createCipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';

  // First, we'll generate the key. The key length is dependent on the algorithm.
  // In this case for aes192, it is 24 bytes (192 bits).
  scrypt(password, 'salt', 24, (err, key) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    // Then, we'll generate a random initialization vector
    randomFill(new Uint8Array(16), (err, iv) => {
      if (err) throw err;

      const cipher = createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

      const input = createReadStream('test.js');
      const output = createWriteStream('test.enc');

      pipeline(input, cipher, output, (err) => {
        if (err) throw err;
      });
    });
  });
  ```

  Example: Using the `cipher.update()` and `cipher.final()` methods:

  ```
  const {
    scrypt,
    randomFill,
    createCipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';

  + [allowHalfOpen](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/allowHalfOpen): boolean

    If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`.

    This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing `Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
  + readonly [closed](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/closed): boolean

    Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
  + [destroyed](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/destroyed): boolean

    Is `true` after `readable.destroy()` has been called.
  + readonly [errored](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/errored): null | [Error](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Error)

    Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
  + [readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/readable): boolean

    Is `true` if it is safe to call read, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
  + readonly [readableAborted](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/readableAborted): boolean

    Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.

    Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
  + readonly [writable](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/writable): boolean

    Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
  + readonly [writableAborted](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/writableAborted): boolean

    Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'finish'`.
  + readonly [writableCorked](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/writableCorked): number

    Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
  + readonly [writableEnded](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/writableEnded): boolean

    Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.
  + readonly [writableFinished](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/writableFinished): boolean

    This method returns a new stream with chunks of the underlying stream paired with a counter in the form `[index, chunk]`. The first index value is `0` and it increases by 1 for each chunk produced.

  + [cork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/cork)(): void;

    The `writable.cork()` method forces all written data to be buffered in memory. The buffered data will be flushed when either the uncork or end methods are called.

    The primary intent of `writable.cork()` is to accommodate a situation in which several small chunks are written to the stream in rapid succession. Instead of immediately forwarding them to the underlying destination, `writable.cork()` buffers all the chunks until `writable.uncork()` is called, which will pass them all to `writable._writev()`, if present. This prevents a head-of-line blocking situation where data is being buffered while waiting for the first small chunk to be processed. However, use of `writable.cork()` without implementing `writable._writev()` may have an adverse effect on throughput.

    See also: `writable.uncork()`, `writable._writev()`.

    Once `destroy()` has been called any further calls will be a no-op and no further errors except from `_destroy()` may be emitted as `'error'`.

    Implementors should not override this method, but instead implement `readable._destroy()`.

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.every` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream to check if all awaited return values are truthy value for *fn*. Once an *fn* call on a chunk `await`ed return value is falsy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with `false`. If all of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a truthy value, the promise is fulfilled with `true`.

    ): Promise<undefined | T>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.find` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream to find a chunk with a truthy value for *fn*. Once an *fn* call's awaited return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with value for which *fn* returned a truthy value. If all of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a falsy value, the promise is fulfilled with `undefined`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise evaluating to the first chunk for which *fn* evaluated with a truthy value, or `undefined` if no element was found.

  + [flatMap](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/flatMap)(

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method returns a new stream by applying the given callback to each chunk of the stream and then flattening the result.

    It is possible to return a stream or another iterable or async iterable from *fn* and the result streams will be merged (flattened) into the returned stream.

    @param fn

    a function to map over every chunk in the stream. May be async. May be a stream or generator.

    @returns

    a stream flat-mapped with the function *fn*.
  + [forEach](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/forEach)(

    fn: (data: any, options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>) => void | Promise<void>,

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<void>;

    This method allows iterating a stream. For each chunk in the stream the *fn* function will be called. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed.

    This method is different from `for await...of` loops in that it can optionally process chunks concurrently. In addition, a `forEach` iteration can only be stopped by having passed a `signal` option and aborting the related AbortController while `for await...of` can be stopped with `break` or `return`. In either case the stream will be destroyed.

    This method is different from listening to the `'data'` event in that it uses the `readable` event in the underlying machinary and can limit the number of concurrent *fn* calls.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise for when the stream has finished.
  + [getAuthTag](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/getAuthTag)(): NonSharedBuffer;
  + [getMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/getMaxListeners)(): number;

    Returns the current max listener value for the `EventEmitter` which is either set by `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` or defaults to EventEmitter.defaultMaxListeners.
  + [isPaused](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/isPaused)(): boolean;

    The `readable.isPaused()` method returns the current operating state of the `Readable`. This is used primarily by the mechanism that underlies the `readable.pipe()` method. In most typical cases, there will be no reason to use this method directly.

    ```
    const readable = new stream.Readable();

    readable.isPaused(); // === false
    readable.pause();
    readable.isPaused(); // === true
    readable.resume();
    readable.isPaused(); // === false
    ```
  + [iterator](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/iterator)(

    options?: { destroyOnReturn: boolean }

    ): AsyncIterator<any>;

    The iterator created by this method gives users the option to cancel the destruction of the stream if the `for await...of` loop is exited by `return`, `break`, or `throw`, or if the iterator should destroy the stream if the stream emitted an error during iteration.
  + [listenerCount](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/listenerCount)<K>(

    eventName: string | symbol,

    listener?: Function

    ): number;

    Returns the number of listeners listening for the event named `eventName`. If `listener` is provided, it will return how many times the listener is found in the list of the listeners of the event.

    @param eventName

    The name of the event being listened for

    @param listener

    The event handler function
  + [listeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/listeners)<K>(

    eventName: string | symbol

      console.log('someone connected!');
    });
    console.log(util.inspect(server.listeners('connection')));
    // Prints: [ [Function] ]

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method allows mapping over the stream. The *fn* function will be called for every chunk in the stream. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed before being passed to the result stream.

    @param fn

    a function to map over every chunk in the stream. Async or not.

    a stream mapped with the function *fn*.
  + [off](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/off)<K>(

  + [on](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/on)(

    event: 'close',

    listener: () => void

    ): this;

    Adds the `listener` function to the end of the listeners array for the event named `eventName`. No checks are made to see if the `listener` has already been added. Multiple calls passing the same combination of `eventName` and `listener` will result in the `listener` being added, and called, multiple times.

    ```
    server.on('connection', (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    });
    ```

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

    By default, event listeners are invoked in the order they are added. The `emitter.prependListener()` method can be used as an alternative to add the event listener to the beginning of the listeners array.

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const myEE = new EventEmitter();
    myEE.on('foo', () => console.log('a'));
    myEE.prependListener('foo', () => console.log('b'));

    ```
  + [read](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/read)(

    size?: number

    ): any;

    The `readable.read()` method reads data out of the internal buffer and returns it. If no data is available to be read, `null` is returned. By default, the data is returned as a `Buffer` object unless an encoding has been specified using the `readable.setEncoding()` method or the stream is operating in object mode.

    The optional `size` argument specifies a specific number of bytes to read. If `size` bytes are not available to be read, `null` will be returned *unless* the stream has ended, in which case all of the data remaining in the internal buffer will be returned.

    If the `size` argument is not specified, all of the data contained in the internal buffer will be returned.

    The `size` argument must be less than or equal to 1 GiB.

    The `readable.read()` method should only be called on `Readable` streams operating in paused mode. In flowing mode, `readable.read()` is called automatically until the internal buffer is fully drained.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();

    // 'readable' may be triggered multiple times as data is buffered in
    readable.on('readable', () => {
      let chunk;
      console.log('Stream is readable (new data received in buffer)');
      // Use a loop to make sure we read all currently available data
      while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
        console.log(`Read ${chunk.length} bytes of data...`);
      }
    });

    // 'end' will be triggered once when there is no more data available
    readable.on('end', () => {
      console.log('Reached end of stream.');
    });
    ```

    Each call to `readable.read()` returns a chunk of data, or `null`. The chunks are not concatenated. A `while` loop is necessary to consume all data currently in the buffer. When reading a large file `.read()` may return `null`, having consumed all buffered content so far, but there is still more data to come not yet buffered. In this case a new `'readable'` event will be emitted when there is more data in the buffer. Finally the `'end'` event will be emitted when there is no more data to come.

    Therefore to read a file's whole contents from a `readable`, it is necessary to collect chunks across multiple `'readable'` events:

    ```
    const chunks = [];

    readable.on('readable', () => {
      let chunk;
      while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
        chunks.push(chunk);
      }
    });

    readable.on('end', () => {
      const content = chunks.join('');
    });
    ```

    A `Readable` stream in object mode will always return a single item from a call to `readable.read(size)`, regardless of the value of the `size` argument.

    If the `readable.read()` method returns a chunk of data, a `'data'` event will also be emitted.

    Calling read after the `'end'` event has been emitted will return `null`. No runtime error will be raised.

    Optional argument to specify how much data to read.

  + [removeAllListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/removeAllListeners)(

    eventName?: string | symbol

    ): this;

    Removes all listeners, or those of the specified `eventName`.

    It is bad practice to remove listeners added elsewhere in the code, particularly when the `EventEmitter` instance was created by some other component or module (e.g. sockets or file streams).

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [removeListener](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/removeListener)(

    event: 'close',

    listener: () => void

    ): this;

    Removes the specified `listener` from the listener array for the event named `eventName`.

    ```
    const callback = (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    };
    server.on('connection', callback);
    // ...
    server.removeListener('connection', callback);
    ```

    `removeListener()` will remove, at most, one instance of a listener from the listener array. If any single listener has been added multiple times to the listener array for the specified `eventName`, then `removeListener()` must be called multiple times to remove each instance.

    Once an event is emitted, all listeners attached to it at the time of emitting are called in order. This implies that any `removeListener()` or `removeAllListeners()` calls *after* emitting and *before* the last listener finishes execution will not remove them from`emit()` in progress. Subsequent events behave as expected.

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}
    const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

    const callbackA = () => {
      console.log('A');
      myEmitter.removeListener('event', callbackB);
    };

    const callbackB = () => {
      console.log('B');
    };

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackA);

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackB);

    // callbackA removes listener callbackB but it will still be called.
    // Internal listener array at time of emit [callbackA, callbackB]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    //   B

    // callbackB is now removed.
    // Internal listener array [callbackA]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    ```

    Because listeners are managed using an internal array, calling this will change the position indices of any listener registered *after* the listener being removed. This will not impact the order in which listeners are called, but it means that any copies of the listener array as returned by the `emitter.listeners()` method will need to be recreated.

    When a single function has been added as a handler multiple times for a single event (as in the example below), `removeListener()` will remove the most recently added instance. In the example the `once('ping')` listener is removed:

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const ee = new EventEmitter();

    function pong() {
      console.log('pong');
    }

    ee.on('ping', pong);
    ee.once('ping', pong);
    ee.removeListener('ping', pong);

    ee.emit('ping');
    ee.emit('ping');
    ```

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

  + [resume](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/resume)(): this;

    The `readable.resume()` method causes an explicitly paused `Readable` stream to resume emitting `'data'` events, switching the stream into flowing mode.

    The `readable.resume()` method can be used to fully consume the data from a stream without actually processing any of that data:

    ```
    getReadableStreamSomehow()
      .resume()
      .on('end', () => {
        console.log('Reached the end, but did not read anything.');
      });
    ```

    The `readable.resume()` method has no effect if there is a `'readable'` event listener.

    autoPadding?: boolean

    When using block encryption algorithms, the `Cipheriv` class will automatically add padding to the input data to the appropriate block size. To disable the default padding call `cipher.setAutoPadding(false)`.

    When `autoPadding` is `false`, the length of the entire input data must be a multiple of the cipher's block size or `cipher.final()` will throw an error. Disabling automatic padding is useful for non-standard padding, for instance using `0x0` instead of PKCS padding.

    The `cipher.setAutoPadding()` method must be called before `cipher.final()`.

    @returns

    for method chaining.
  + [setDefaultEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/setDefaultEncoding)(

    encoding: BufferEncoding

    ): this;

    The `writable.setDefaultEncoding()` method sets the default `encoding` for a `Writable` stream.

    @param encoding

    The new default encoding
  + [setEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/setEncoding)(

    encoding: BufferEncoding

    ): this;

    The `readable.setEncoding()` method sets the character encoding for data read from the `Readable` stream.

    By default, no encoding is assigned and stream data will be returned as `Buffer` objects. Setting an encoding causes the stream data to be returned as strings of the specified encoding rather than as `Buffer` objects. For instance, calling `readable.setEncoding('utf8')` will cause the output data to be interpreted as UTF-8 data, and passed as strings. Calling `readable.setEncoding('hex')` will cause the data to be encoded in hexadecimal string format.

    The `Readable` stream will properly handle multi-byte characters delivered through the stream that would otherwise become improperly decoded if simply pulled from the stream as `Buffer` objects.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
    readable.setEncoding('utf8');
    readable.on('data', (chunk) => {
      assert.equal(typeof chunk, 'string');
      console.log('Got %d characters of string data:', chunk.length);

    The encoding to use.
  + [setMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/setMaxListeners)(

    n: number

    ): this;

    By default `EventEmitter`s will print a warning if more than `10` listeners are added for a particular event. This is a useful default that helps finding memory leaks. The `emitter.setMaxListeners()` method allows the limit to be modified for this specific `EventEmitter` instance. The value can be set to `Infinity` (or `0`) to indicate an unlimited number of listeners.

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [some](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/some)(

    fn: (data: any, options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>) => boolean | Promise<boolean>,

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<boolean>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.some` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream until the awaited return value is `true` (or any truthy value). Once an *fn* call on a chunk `await`ed return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with `true`. If none of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a truthy value, the promise is fulfilled with `false`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise evaluating to `true` if *fn* returned a truthy value for at least one of the chunks.

    This method returns a new stream with the first *limit* chunks.

    a stream with *limit* chunks taken.

    options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>

    ): Promise<any[]>;

    This method allows easily obtaining the contents of a stream.

    As this method reads the entire stream into memory, it negates the benefits of streams. It's intended for interoperability and convenience, not as the primary way to consume streams.

    @returns

    a promise containing an array with the contents of the stream.
  + [uncork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/uncork)(): void;

    The `writable.uncork()` method flushes all data buffered since cork was called.

    When using `writable.cork()` and `writable.uncork()` to manage the buffering of writes to a stream, defer calls to `writable.uncork()` using `process.nextTick()`. Doing so allows batching of all `writable.write()` calls that occur within a given Node.js event loop phase.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => stream.uncork());
    ```

    If the `writable.cork()` method is called multiple times on a stream, the same number of calls to `writable.uncork()` must be called to flush the buffered data.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => {
      stream.uncork();
      // The data will not be flushed until uncork() is called a second time.
      stream.uncork();
    });
    ```

    See also: `writable.cork()`.
  + [unpipe](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/unpipe)(

    destination?: WritableStream

    ): this;

    The `readable.unpipe()` method detaches a `Writable` stream previously attached using the pipe method.

    If the `destination` is not specified, then *all* pipes are detached.

    If the `destination` is specified, but no pipe is set up for it, then the method does nothing.

    ```
    import fs from 'node:fs';
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
    const writable = fs.createWriteStream('file.txt');
    // All the data from readable goes into 'file.txt',
    // but only for the first second.
    readable.pipe(writable);
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Stop writing to file.txt.');
      readable.unpipe(writable);
      console.log('Manually close the file stream.');
      writable.end();
    }, 1000);
    ```

    @param destination

    Optional specific stream to unpipe
  + [unshift](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherCCM/unshift)(

    chunk: any,

    encoding?: BufferEncoding

    ): void;

    Passing `chunk` as `null` signals the end of the stream (EOF) and behaves the same as `readable.push(null)`, after which no more data can be written. The EOF signal is put at the end of the buffer and any buffered data will still be flushed.

    The `readable.unshift()` method pushes a chunk of data back into the internal buffer. This is useful in certain situations where a stream is being consumed by code that needs to "un-consume" some amount of data that it has optimistically pulled out of the source, so that the data can be passed on to some other party.

    The `stream.unshift(chunk)` method cannot be called after the `'end'` event has been emitted or a runtime error will be thrown.

    Developers using `stream.unshift()` often should consider switching to use of a `Transform` stream instead. See the `API for stream implementers` section for more information.

    ```
    // Pull off a header delimited by \n\n.
    // Use unshift() if we get too much.
    // Call the callback with (error, header, stream).
    import { StringDecoder } from 'node:string_decoder';
    function parseHeader(stream, callback) {
      stream.on('error', callback);
      stream.on('readable', onReadable);
      const decoder = new StringDecoder('utf8');
      let header = '';
      function onReadable() {
        let chunk;
        while (null !== (chunk = stream.read())) {
          const str = decoder.write(chunk);
          if (str.includes('\n\n')) {
            // Found the header boundary.
            const split = str.split(/\n\n/);
            header += split.shift();
            const remaining = split.join('\n\n');
            const buf = Buffer.from(remaining, 'utf8');
            stream.removeListener('error', callback);
            // Remove the 'readable' listener before unshifting.
            stream.removeListener('readable', onReadable);
            if (buf.length)
              stream.unshift(buf);
            // Now the body of the message can be read from the stream.
            callback(null, header, stream);
            return;
          }
          // Still reading the header.
          header += str;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Unlike push, `stream.unshift(chunk)` will not end the reading process by resetting the internal reading state of the stream. This can cause unexpected results if `readable.unshift()` is called during a read (i.e. from within a \_read implementation on a custom stream). Following the call to `readable.unshift()` with an immediate push will reset the reading state appropriately, however it is best to simply avoid calling `readable.unshift()` while in the process of performing a read.

    @param chunk

    Chunk of data to unshift onto the read queue. For streams not operating in object mode, `chunk` must be a {string}, {Buffer}, {TypedArray}, {DataView} or `null`. For object mode streams, `chunk` may be any JavaScript value.

    stream: ReadableStream

    ): this;

    Prior to Node.js 0.10, streams did not implement the entire `node:stream` module API as it is currently defined. (See `Compatibility` for more information.)

    When using an older Node.js library that emits `'data'` events and has a pause method that is advisory only, the `readable.wrap()` method can be used to create a `Readable` stream that uses the old stream as its data source.

    It will rarely be necessary to use `readable.wrap()` but the method has been provided as a convenience for interacting with older Node.js applications and libraries.

    ```
    import { OldReader } from './old-api-module.js';
    import { Readable } from 'node:stream';
    const oreader = new OldReader();
    const myReader = new Readable().wrap(oreader);

    chunk: any,

    callback?: (error: undefined | null | [Error](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Error)) => void

    ): boolean;

    The `writable.write()` method writes some data to the stream, and calls the supplied `callback` once the data has been fully handled. If an error occurs, the `callback` will be called with the error as its first argument. The `callback` is called asynchronously and before `'error'` is emitted.

    The return value is `true` if the internal buffer is less than the `highWaterMark` configured when the stream was created after admitting `chunk`. If `false` is returned, further attempts to write data to the stream should stop until the `'drain'` event is emitted.

    While a stream is not draining, calls to `write()` will buffer `chunk`, and return false. Once all currently buffered chunks are drained (accepted for delivery by the operating system), the `'drain'` event will be emitted. Once `write()` returns false, do not write more chunks until the `'drain'` event is emitted. While calling `write()` on a stream that is not draining is allowed, Node.js will buffer all written chunks until maximum memory usage occurs, at which point it will abort unconditionally. Even before it aborts, high memory usage will cause poor garbage collector performance and high RSS (which is not typically released back to the system, even after the memory is no longer required). Since TCP sockets may never drain if the remote peer does not read the data, writing a socket that is not draining may lead to a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

    Writing data while the stream is not draining is particularly problematic for a `Transform`, because the `Transform` streams are paused by default until they are piped or a `'data'` or `'readable'` event handler is added.

    If the data to be written can be generated or fetched on demand, it is recommended to encapsulate the logic into a `Readable` and use pipe. However, if calling `write()` is preferred, it is possible to respect backpressure and avoid memory issues using the `'drain'` event:

    ```
    function write(data, cb) {
      if (!stream.write(data)) {
        stream.once('drain', cb);
      } else {
        process.nextTick(cb);
      }
    }

    // Wait for cb to be called before doing any other write.
    write('hello', () => {
      console.log('Write completed, do more writes now.');

    A `Writable` stream in object mode will always ignore the `encoding` argument.

* ### interface [CipherChaCha20Poly1305](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305)

  Instances of the `Cipheriv` class are used to encrypt data. The class can be used in one of two ways:

  + As a `stream` that is both readable and writable, where plain unencrypted data is written to produce encrypted data on the readable side, or
  + Using the `cipher.update()` and `cipher.final()` methods to produce the encrypted data.

  The createCipheriv method is used to create `Cipheriv` instances. `Cipheriv` objects are not to be created directly using the `new` keyword.

  Example: Using `Cipheriv` objects as streams:

  ```
  const {
    scrypt,
    randomFill,
    createCipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';

  // First, we'll generate the key. The key length is dependent on the algorithm.
  // In this case for aes192, it is 24 bytes (192 bits).
  scrypt(password, 'salt', 24, (err, key) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    // Then, we'll generate a random initialization vector
    randomFill(new Uint8Array(16), (err, iv) => {
      if (err) throw err;

      // Once we have the key and iv, we can create and use the cipher...
      const cipher = createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

      let encrypted = '';
      cipher.setEncoding('hex');

      cipher.on('data', (chunk) => encrypted += chunk);
      cipher.on('end', () => console.log(encrypted));

      cipher.write('some clear text data');
      cipher.end();
    });
  });
  ```

  Example: Using `Cipheriv` and piped streams:

  ```
  import {
    createReadStream,
    createWriteStream,
  } from 'node:fs';

  import {
    pipeline,
  } from 'node:stream';

  const {
    scrypt,
    randomFill,
    createCipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';

  // First, we'll generate the key. The key length is dependent on the algorithm.
  // In this case for aes192, it is 24 bytes (192 bits).
  scrypt(password, 'salt', 24, (err, key) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    // Then, we'll generate a random initialization vector
    randomFill(new Uint8Array(16), (err, iv) => {
      if (err) throw err;

      const cipher = createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

      const input = createReadStream('test.js');
      const output = createWriteStream('test.enc');

      pipeline(input, cipher, output, (err) => {
        if (err) throw err;
      });
    });
  });
  ```

  Example: Using the `cipher.update()` and `cipher.final()` methods:

  ```
  const {
    scrypt,
    randomFill,
    createCipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';

  // First, we'll generate the key. The key length is dependent on the algorithm.
  // In this case for aes192, it is 24 bytes (192 bits).
  scrypt(password, 'salt', 24, (err, key) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    // Then, we'll generate a random initialization vector
    randomFill(new Uint8Array(16), (err, iv) => {
      if (err) throw err;

      const cipher = createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

      let encrypted = cipher.update('some clear text data', 'utf8', 'hex');
      encrypted += cipher.final('hex');
      console.log(encrypted);
    });
  });
  ```

  + [allowHalfOpen](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/allowHalfOpen): boolean

    If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`.

    This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing `Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
  + readonly [closed](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/closed): boolean

  + readonly [readableObjectMode](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/readableObjectMode): boolean

    Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
  + readonly [writable](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/writable): boolean

    Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
  + readonly [writableAborted](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/writableAborted): boolean

    Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'finish'`.

    This method returns a new stream with chunks of the underlying stream paired with a counter in the form `[index, chunk]`. The first index value is `0` and it increases by 1 for each chunk produced.

  + [cork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/cork)(): void;

    The `writable.cork()` method forces all written data to be buffered in memory. The buffered data will be flushed when either the uncork or end methods are called.

    The primary intent of `writable.cork()` is to accommodate a situation in which several small chunks are written to the stream in rapid succession. Instead of immediately forwarding them to the underlying destination, `writable.cork()` buffers all the chunks until `writable.uncork()` is called, which will pass them all to `writable._writev()`, if present. This prevents a head-of-line blocking situation where data is being buffered while waiting for the first small chunk to be processed. However, use of `writable.cork()` without implementing `writable._writev()` may have an adverse effect on throughput.

    See also: `writable.uncork()`, `writable._writev()`.
  + [destroy](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/destroy)(

    Destroy the stream. Optionally emit an `'error'` event, and emit a `'close'` event (unless `emitClose` is set to `false`). After this call, the readable stream will release any internal resources and subsequent calls to `push()` will be ignored.

    Once `destroy()` has been called any further calls will be a no-op and no further errors except from `_destroy()` may be emitted as `'error'`.

    Implementors should not override this method, but instead implement `readable._destroy()`.

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<boolean>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.every` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream to check if all awaited return values are truthy value for *fn*. Once an *fn* call on a chunk `await`ed return value is falsy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with `false`. If all of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a truthy value, the promise is fulfilled with `true`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise evaluating to `true` if *fn* returned a truthy value for every one of the chunks.

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method allows filtering the stream. For each chunk in the stream the *fn* function will be called and if it returns a truthy value, the chunk will be passed to the result stream. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed.

    @param fn

    a function to filter chunks from the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a stream filtered with the predicate *fn*.
  + [final](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/final)(): NonSharedBuffer;

    Once the `cipher.final()` method has been called, the `Cipheriv` object can no longer be used to encrypt data. Attempts to call `cipher.final()` more than once will result in an error being thrown.

    @returns

    Any remaining enciphered contents. If `outputEncoding` is specified, a string is returned. If an `outputEncoding` is not provided, a Buffer is returned.

    [final](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/final)(

    ): string;

    Once the `cipher.final()` method has been called, the `Cipheriv` object can no longer be used to encrypt data. Attempts to call `cipher.final()` more than once will result in an error being thrown.

    @param outputEncoding

    The `encoding` of the return value.

    @returns

    Any remaining enciphered contents. If `outputEncoding` is specified, a string is returned. If an `outputEncoding` is not provided, a Buffer is returned.

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<undefined | T>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.find` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream to find a chunk with a truthy value for *fn*. Once an *fn* call's awaited return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with value for which *fn* returned a truthy value. If all of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a falsy value, the promise is fulfilled with `undefined`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise evaluating to the first chunk for which *fn* evaluated with a truthy value, or `undefined` if no element was found.

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method returns a new stream by applying the given callback to each chunk of the stream and then flattening the result.

    It is possible to return a stream or another iterable or async iterable from *fn* and the result streams will be merged (flattened) into the returned stream.

    @param fn

    a function to map over every chunk in the stream. May be async. May be a stream or generator.

    @returns

    a stream flat-mapped with the function *fn*.
  + [forEach](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/forEach)(

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<void>;

    This method allows iterating a stream. For each chunk in the stream the *fn* function will be called. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed.

    This method is different from `for await...of` loops in that it can optionally process chunks concurrently. In addition, a `forEach` iteration can only be stopped by having passed a `signal` option and aborting the related AbortController while `for await...of` can be stopped with `break` or `return`. In either case the stream will be destroyed.

    This method is different from listening to the `'data'` event in that it uses the `readable` event in the underlying machinary and can limit the number of concurrent *fn* calls.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise for when the stream has finished.

    Returns the current max listener value for the `EventEmitter` which is either set by `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` or defaults to EventEmitter.defaultMaxListeners.
  + [isPaused](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/isPaused)(): boolean;

    The `readable.isPaused()` method returns the current operating state of the `Readable`. This is used primarily by the mechanism that underlies the `readable.pipe()` method. In most typical cases, there will be no reason to use this method directly.

    ```
    const readable = new stream.Readable();

    readable.isPaused(); // === false
    readable.pause();
    readable.isPaused(); // === true
    readable.resume();
    readable.isPaused(); // === false
    ```
  + [iterator](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/iterator)(

    options?: { destroyOnReturn: boolean }

    ): AsyncIterator<any>;

    The iterator created by this method gives users the option to cancel the destruction of the stream if the `for await...of` loop is exited by `return`, `break`, or `throw`, or if the iterator should destroy the stream if the stream emitted an error during iteration.
  + [listenerCount](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/listenerCount)<K>(

    eventName: string | symbol,

    listener?: Function

    ): number;

    Returns the number of listeners listening for the event named `eventName`. If `listener` is provided, it will return how many times the listener is found in the list of the listeners of the event.

    @param eventName

    The name of the event being listened for

    The event handler function
  + [listeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/listeners)<K>(

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method allows mapping over the stream. The *fn* function will be called for every chunk in the stream. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed before being passed to the result stream.

    @param fn

    a function to map over every chunk in the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a stream mapped with the function *fn*.

  + [on](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/on)(

    event: 'close',

    listener: () => void

    ): this;

    Adds the `listener` function to the end of the listeners array for the event named `eventName`. No checks are made to see if the `listener` has already been added. Multiple calls passing the same combination of `eventName` and `listener` will result in the `listener` being added, and called, multiple times.

    ```
    server.on('connection', (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    });
    ```

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

    By default, event listeners are invoked in the order they are added. The `emitter.prependListener()` method can be used as an alternative to add the event listener to the beginning of the listeners array.

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const myEE = new EventEmitter();
    myEE.on('foo', () => console.log('a'));
    myEE.prependListener('foo', () => console.log('b'));

  + [read](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/read)(

    size?: number

    ): any;

    The `readable.read()` method reads data out of the internal buffer and returns it. If no data is available to be read, `null` is returned. By default, the data is returned as a `Buffer` object unless an encoding has been specified using the `readable.setEncoding()` method or the stream is operating in object mode.

    The optional `size` argument specifies a specific number of bytes to read. If `size` bytes are not available to be read, `null` will be returned *unless* the stream has ended, in which case all of the data remaining in the internal buffer will be returned.

    If the `size` argument is not specified, all of the data contained in the internal buffer will be returned.

    The `size` argument must be less than or equal to 1 GiB.

    The `readable.read()` method should only be called on `Readable` streams operating in paused mode. In flowing mode, `readable.read()` is called automatically until the internal buffer is fully drained.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();

    // 'readable' may be triggered multiple times as data is buffered in
    readable.on('readable', () => {
      let chunk;
      console.log('Stream is readable (new data received in buffer)');
      // Use a loop to make sure we read all currently available data
      while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
        console.log(`Read ${chunk.length} bytes of data...`);
      }
    });

    // 'end' will be triggered once when there is no more data available
    readable.on('end', () => {
      console.log('Reached end of stream.');
    });
    ```

    Each call to `readable.read()` returns a chunk of data, or `null`. The chunks are not concatenated. A `while` loop is necessary to consume all data currently in the buffer. When reading a large file `.read()` may return `null`, having consumed all buffered content so far, but there is still more data to come not yet buffered. In this case a new `'readable'` event will be emitted when there is more data in the buffer. Finally the `'end'` event will be emitted when there is no more data to come.

    Therefore to read a file's whole contents from a `readable`, it is necessary to collect chunks across multiple `'readable'` events:

    ```
    const chunks = [];

    readable.on('readable', () => {
      let chunk;
      while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
        chunks.push(chunk);
      }
    });

    readable.on('end', () => {
      const content = chunks.join('');
    });
    ```

    A `Readable` stream in object mode will always return a single item from a call to `readable.read(size)`, regardless of the value of the `size` argument.

    If the `readable.read()` method returns a chunk of data, a `'data'` event will also be emitted.

    Calling read after the `'end'` event has been emitted will return `null`. No runtime error will be raised.

    @param size

    Optional argument to specify how much data to read.

    initial?: undefined,

    options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>

    ): Promise<T>;

    This method calls *fn* on each chunk of the stream in order, passing it the result from the calculation on the previous element. It returns a promise for the final value of the reduction.

    If no *initial* value is supplied the first chunk of the stream is used as the initial value. If the stream is empty, the promise is rejected with a `TypeError` with the `ERR_INVALID_ARGS` code property.

    The reducer function iterates the stream element-by-element which means that there is no *concurrency* parameter or parallelism. To perform a reduce concurrently, you can extract the async function to `readable.map` method.

    @param fn

    a reducer function to call over every chunk in the stream. Async or not.

    @param initial

    the initial value to use in the reduction.

    @returns

    a promise for the final value of the reduction.

  + [removeAllListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/removeAllListeners)(

    eventName?: string | symbol

    ): this;

    Removes all listeners, or those of the specified `eventName`.

    It is bad practice to remove listeners added elsewhere in the code, particularly when the `EventEmitter` instance was created by some other component or module (e.g. sockets or file streams).

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [removeListener](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/removeListener)(

    event: 'close',

    listener: () => void

    ): this;

    Removes the specified `listener` from the listener array for the event named `eventName`.

    ```
    const callback = (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    };
    server.on('connection', callback);
    // ...
    server.removeListener('connection', callback);
    ```

    `removeListener()` will remove, at most, one instance of a listener from the listener array. If any single listener has been added multiple times to the listener array for the specified `eventName`, then `removeListener()` must be called multiple times to remove each instance.

    Once an event is emitted, all listeners attached to it at the time of emitting are called in order. This implies that any `removeListener()` or `removeAllListeners()` calls *after* emitting and *before* the last listener finishes execution will not remove them from`emit()` in progress. Subsequent events behave as expected.

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}
    const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

    const callbackA = () => {
      console.log('A');
      myEmitter.removeListener('event', callbackB);
    };

    const callbackB = () => {
      console.log('B');
    };

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackA);

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackB);

    // callbackA removes listener callbackB but it will still be called.
    // Internal listener array at time of emit [callbackA, callbackB]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    //   B

    // callbackB is now removed.
    // Internal listener array [callbackA]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    ```

    Because listeners are managed using an internal array, calling this will change the position indices of any listener registered *after* the listener being removed. This will not impact the order in which listeners are called, but it means that any copies of the listener array as returned by the `emitter.listeners()` method will need to be recreated.

    When a single function has been added as a handler multiple times for a single event (as in the example below), `removeListener()` will remove the most recently added instance. In the example the `once('ping')` listener is removed:

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const ee = new EventEmitter();

    function pong() {
      console.log('pong');
    }

    ee.on('ping', pong);
    ee.once('ping', pong);
    ee.removeListener('ping', pong);

    ee.emit('ping');
    ee.emit('ping');
    ```

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

  + [resume](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/resume)(): this;

    The `readable.resume()` method causes an explicitly paused `Readable` stream to resume emitting `'data'` events, switching the stream into flowing mode.

    The `readable.resume()` method can be used to fully consume the data from a stream without actually processing any of that data:

    ```
    getReadableStreamSomehow()
      .resume()
      .on('end', () => {
        console.log('Reached the end, but did not read anything.');
      });

    autoPadding?: boolean

    When using block encryption algorithms, the `Cipheriv` class will automatically add padding to the input data to the appropriate block size. To disable the default padding call `cipher.setAutoPadding(false)`.

    When `autoPadding` is `false`, the length of the entire input data must be a multiple of the cipher's block size or `cipher.final()` will throw an error. Disabling automatic padding is useful for non-standard padding, for instance using `0x0` instead of PKCS padding.

    The `cipher.setAutoPadding()` method must be called before `cipher.final()`.

    @returns

    for method chaining.
  + [setDefaultEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/setDefaultEncoding)(

    encoding: BufferEncoding

    ): this;

    The `writable.setDefaultEncoding()` method sets the default `encoding` for a `Writable` stream.

    @param encoding

    The new default encoding
  + [setEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/setEncoding)(

    encoding: BufferEncoding

    ): this;

    The `readable.setEncoding()` method sets the character encoding for data read from the `Readable` stream.

    By default, no encoding is assigned and stream data will be returned as `Buffer` objects. Setting an encoding causes the stream data to be returned as strings of the specified encoding rather than as `Buffer` objects. For instance, calling `readable.setEncoding('utf8')` will cause the output data to be interpreted as UTF-8 data, and passed as strings. Calling `readable.setEncoding('hex')` will cause the data to be encoded in hexadecimal string format.

    The `Readable` stream will properly handle multi-byte characters delivered through the stream that would otherwise become improperly decoded if simply pulled from the stream as `Buffer` objects.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
    readable.setEncoding('utf8');
    readable.on('data', (chunk) => {
      assert.equal(typeof chunk, 'string');
      console.log('Got %d characters of string data:', chunk.length);

  + [setMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/setMaxListeners)(

    n: number

    ): this;

    By default `EventEmitter`s will print a warning if more than `10` listeners are added for a particular event. This is a useful default that helps finding memory leaks. The `emitter.setMaxListeners()` method allows the limit to be modified for this specific `EventEmitter` instance. The value can be set to `Infinity` (or `0`) to indicate an unlimited number of listeners.

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [some](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/some)(

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<boolean>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.some` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream until the awaited return value is `true` (or any truthy value). Once an *fn* call on a chunk `await`ed return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with `true`. If none of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a truthy value, the promise is fulfilled with `false`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise evaluating to `true` if *fn* returned a truthy value for at least one of the chunks.

    This method returns a new stream with the first *limit* chunks.

    @param limit

    the number of chunks to take from the readable.

    @returns

    a stream with *limit* chunks taken.
  + [toArray](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/toArray)(

    options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>

    ): Promise<any[]>;

    This method allows easily obtaining the contents of a stream.

    As this method reads the entire stream into memory, it negates the benefits of streams. It's intended for interoperability and convenience, not as the primary way to consume streams.

    @returns

    a promise containing an array with the contents of the stream.
  + [uncork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/uncork)(): void;

    The `writable.uncork()` method flushes all data buffered since cork was called.

    When using `writable.cork()` and `writable.uncork()` to manage the buffering of writes to a stream, defer calls to `writable.uncork()` using `process.nextTick()`. Doing so allows batching of all `writable.write()` calls that occur within a given Node.js event loop phase.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => stream.uncork());
    ```

    If the `writable.cork()` method is called multiple times on a stream, the same number of calls to `writable.uncork()` must be called to flush the buffered data.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => {
      stream.uncork();
      // The data will not be flushed until uncork() is called a second time.
      stream.uncork();
    });
    ```

    See also: `writable.cork()`.
  + [unpipe](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/unpipe)(

    destination?: WritableStream

    ): this;

    The `readable.unpipe()` method detaches a `Writable` stream previously attached using the pipe method.

    If the `destination` is not specified, then *all* pipes are detached.

    If the `destination` is specified, but no pipe is set up for it, then the method does nothing.

    ```
    import fs from 'node:fs';
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
    const writable = fs.createWriteStream('file.txt');
    // All the data from readable goes into 'file.txt',
    // but only for the first second.
    readable.pipe(writable);
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Stop writing to file.txt.');
      readable.unpipe(writable);
      console.log('Manually close the file stream.');
      writable.end();
    }, 1000);
    ```

    @param destination

    Optional specific stream to unpipe
  + [unshift](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/unshift)(

    chunk: any,

    encoding?: BufferEncoding

    ): void;

    Passing `chunk` as `null` signals the end of the stream (EOF) and behaves the same as `readable.push(null)`, after which no more data can be written. The EOF signal is put at the end of the buffer and any buffered data will still be flushed.

    The `readable.unshift()` method pushes a chunk of data back into the internal buffer. This is useful in certain situations where a stream is being consumed by code that needs to "un-consume" some amount of data that it has optimistically pulled out of the source, so that the data can be passed on to some other party.

    The `stream.unshift(chunk)` method cannot be called after the `'end'` event has been emitted or a runtime error will be thrown.

    Developers using `stream.unshift()` often should consider switching to use of a `Transform` stream instead. See the `API for stream implementers` section for more information.

    ```
    // Pull off a header delimited by \n\n.
    // Use unshift() if we get too much.
    // Call the callback with (error, header, stream).
    import { StringDecoder } from 'node:string_decoder';
    function parseHeader(stream, callback) {
      stream.on('error', callback);
      stream.on('readable', onReadable);
      const decoder = new StringDecoder('utf8');
      let header = '';
      function onReadable() {
        let chunk;
        while (null !== (chunk = stream.read())) {
          const str = decoder.write(chunk);
          if (str.includes('\n\n')) {
            // Found the header boundary.
            const split = str.split(/\n\n/);
            header += split.shift();
            const remaining = split.join('\n\n');
            const buf = Buffer.from(remaining, 'utf8');
            stream.removeListener('error', callback);
            // Remove the 'readable' listener before unshifting.

    ```

    Unlike push, `stream.unshift(chunk)` will not end the reading process by resetting the internal reading state of the stream. This can cause unexpected results if `readable.unshift()` is called during a read (i.e. from within a \_read implementation on a custom stream). Following the call to `readable.unshift()` with an immediate push will reset the reading state appropriately, however it is best to simply avoid calling `readable.unshift()` while in the process of performing a read.

    @param chunk

    Chunk of data to unshift onto the read queue. For streams not operating in object mode, `chunk` must be a {string}, {Buffer}, {TypedArray}, {DataView} or `null`. For object mode streams, `chunk` may be any JavaScript value.

    @param encoding

    Encoding of string chunks. Must be a valid `Buffer` encoding, such as `'utf8'` or `'ascii'`.

    stream: ReadableStream

    ): this;

    Prior to Node.js 0.10, streams did not implement the entire `node:stream` module API as it is currently defined. (See `Compatibility` for more information.)

    When using an older Node.js library that emits `'data'` events and has a pause method that is advisory only, the `readable.wrap()` method can be used to create a `Readable` stream that uses the old stream as its data source.

    It will rarely be necessary to use `readable.wrap()` but the method has been provided as a convenience for interacting with older Node.js applications and libraries.

    ```
    import { OldReader } from './old-api-module.js';
    import { Readable } from 'node:stream';
    const oreader = new OldReader();
    const myReader = new Readable().wrap(oreader);

    myReader.on('readable', () => {
      myReader.read(); // etc.
    });
    ```

    @param stream

    An "old style" readable stream
  + [write](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherChaCha20Poly1305/write)(

    chunk: any,

    callback?: (error: undefined | null | [Error](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Error)) => void

    ): boolean;

    The `writable.write()` method writes some data to the stream, and calls the supplied `callback` once the data has been fully handled. If an error occurs, the `callback` will be called with the error as its first argument. The `callback` is called asynchronously and before `'error'` is emitted.

    The return value is `true` if the internal buffer is less than the `highWaterMark` configured when the stream was created after admitting `chunk`. If `false` is returned, further attempts to write data to the stream should stop until the `'drain'` event is emitted.

    While a stream is not draining, calls to `write()` will buffer `chunk`, and return false. Once all currently buffered chunks are drained (accepted for delivery by the operating system), the `'drain'` event will be emitted. Once `write()` returns false, do not write more chunks until the `'drain'` event is emitted. While calling `write()` on a stream that is not draining is allowed, Node.js will buffer all written chunks until maximum memory usage occurs, at which point it will abort unconditionally. Even before it aborts, high memory usage will cause poor garbage collector performance and high RSS (which is not typically released back to the system, even after the memory is no longer required). Since TCP sockets may never drain if the remote peer does not read the data, writing a socket that is not draining may lead to a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

    Writing data while the stream is not draining is particularly problematic for a `Transform`, because the `Transform` streams are paused by default until they are piped or a `'data'` or `'readable'` event handler is added.

    If the data to be written can be generated or fetched on demand, it is recommended to encapsulate the logic into a `Readable` and use pipe. However, if calling `write()` is preferred, it is possible to respect backpressure and avoid memory issues using the `'drain'` event:

    ```
    function write(data, cb) {
      if (!stream.write(data)) {
        stream.once('drain', cb);
      } else {
        process.nextTick(cb);
      }
    }

    // Wait for cb to be called before doing any other write.
    write('hello', () => {
      console.log('Write completed, do more writes now.');
    });

* ### interface [CipherGCM](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherGCM)

  Instances of the `Cipheriv` class are used to encrypt data. The class can be used in one of two ways:

  + As a `stream` that is both readable and writable, where plain unencrypted data is written to produce encrypted data on the readable side, or
  + Using the `cipher.update()` and `cipher.final()` methods to produce the encrypted data.

  The createCipheriv method is used to create `Cipheriv` instances. `Cipheriv` objects are not to be created directly using the `new` keyword.

  Example: Using `Cipheriv` objects as streams:

  ```
  const {
    scrypt,
    randomFill,
    createCipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';

  // First, we'll generate the key. The key length is dependent on the algorithm.
  // In this case for aes192, it is 24 bytes (192 bits).
  scrypt(password, 'salt', 24, (err, key) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    // Then, we'll generate a random initialization vector
    randomFill(new Uint8Array(16), (err, iv) => {
      if (err) throw err;

      // Once we have the key and iv, we can create and use the cipher...
      const cipher = createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

      let encrypted = '';
      cipher.setEncoding('hex');

      cipher.on('data', (chunk) => encrypted += chunk);
      cipher.on('end', () => console.log(encrypted));

      cipher.write('some clear text data');
      cipher.end();
    });
  });
  ```

  Example: Using `Cipheriv` and piped streams:

  ```
  import {
    createReadStream,
    createWriteStream,
  } from 'node:fs';

  import {
    pipeline,
  } from 'node:stream';

  const {
    scrypt,
    randomFill,
    createCipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';

  // First, we'll generate the key. The key length is dependent on the algorithm.
  // In this case for aes192, it is 24 bytes (192 bits).
  scrypt(password, 'salt', 24, (err, key) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    // Then, we'll generate a random initialization vector
    randomFill(new Uint8Array(16), (err, iv) => {
      if (err) throw err;

      const cipher = createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

      const input = createReadStream('test.js');
      const output = createWriteStream('test.enc');

      pipeline(input, cipher, output, (err) => {
        if (err) throw err;
      });
    });
  });
  ```

  Example: Using the `cipher.update()` and `cipher.final()` methods:

  ```
  const {
    scrypt,
    randomFill,
    createCipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';

  // First, we'll generate the key. The key length is dependent on the algorithm.
  // In this case for aes192, it is 24 bytes (192 bits).
  scrypt(password, 'salt', 24, (err, key) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    // Then, we'll generate a random initialization vector
    randomFill(new Uint8Array(16), (err, iv) => {
      if (err) throw err;

      const cipher = createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

      let encrypted = cipher.update('some clear text data', 'utf8', 'hex');
      encrypted += cipher.final('hex');
      console.log(encrypted);
    });
  });
  ```

    This method returns a new stream with chunks of the underlying stream paired with a counter in the form `[index, chunk]`. The first index value is `0` and it increases by 1 for each chunk produced.

  + [cork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherGCM/cork)(): void;

    The `writable.cork()` method forces all written data to be buffered in memory. The buffered data will be flushed when either the uncork or end methods are called.

    The primary intent of `writable.cork()` is to accommodate a situation in which several small chunks are written to the stream in rapid succession. Instead of immediately forwarding them to the underlying destination, `writable.cork()` buffers all the chunks until `writable.uncork()` is called, which will pass them all to `writable._writev()`, if present. This prevents a head-of-line blocking situation where data is being buffered while waiting for the first small chunk to be processed. However, use of `writable.cork()` without implementing `writable._writev()` may have an adverse effect on throughput.

    See also: `writable.uncork()`, `writable._writev()`.

    Destroy the stream. Optionally emit an `'error'` event, and emit a `'close'` event (unless `emitClose` is set to `false`). After this call, the readable stream will release any internal resources and subsequent calls to `push()` will be ignored.

    Once `destroy()` has been called any further calls will be a no-op and no further errors except from `_destroy()` may be emitted as `'error'`.

    Implementors should not override this method, but instead implement `readable._destroy()`.

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<boolean>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.every` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream to check if all awaited return values are truthy value for *fn*. Once an *fn* call on a chunk `await`ed return value is falsy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with `false`. If all of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a truthy value, the promise is fulfilled with `true`.

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.find` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream to find a chunk with a truthy value for *fn*. Once an *fn* call's awaited return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with value for which *fn* returned a truthy value. If all of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a falsy value, the promise is fulfilled with `undefined`.

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method returns a new stream by applying the given callback to each chunk of the stream and then flattening the result.

    It is possible to return a stream or another iterable or async iterable from *fn* and the result streams will be merged (flattened) into the returned stream.

    @param fn

    a function to map over every chunk in the stream. May be async. May be a stream or generator.

    @returns

    a stream flat-mapped with the function *fn*.

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<void>;

    This method allows iterating a stream. For each chunk in the stream the *fn* function will be called. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed.

    This method is different from `for await...of` loops in that it can optionally process chunks concurrently. In addition, a `forEach` iteration can only be stopped by having passed a `signal` option and aborting the related AbortController while `for await...of` can be stopped with `break` or `return`. In either case the stream will be destroyed.

    This method is different from listening to the `'data'` event in that it uses the `readable` event in the underlying machinary and can limit the number of concurrent *fn* calls.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise for when the stream has finished.

  + [isPaused](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherGCM/isPaused)(): boolean;

    The `readable.isPaused()` method returns the current operating state of the `Readable`. This is used primarily by the mechanism that underlies the `readable.pipe()` method. In most typical cases, there will be no reason to use this method directly.

    ```
    const readable = new stream.Readable();

    readable.isPaused(); // === false
    readable.pause();
    readable.isPaused(); // === true
    readable.resume();
    readable.isPaused(); // === false
    ```
  + [iterator](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherGCM/iterator)(

    options?: { destroyOnReturn: boolean }

    ): AsyncIterator<any>;

    The iterator created by this method gives users the option to cancel the destruction of the stream if the `for await...of` loop is exited by `return`, `break`, or `throw`, or if the iterator should destroy the stream if the stream emitted an error during iteration.
  + [listenerCount](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherGCM/listenerCount)<K>(

    eventName: string | symbol,

    listener?: Function

    Returns the number of listeners listening for the event named `eventName`. If `listener` is provided, it will return how many times the listener is found in the list of the listeners of the event.

    @param eventName

    The name of the event being listened for

    @param listener

    The event handler function
  + [listeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherGCM/listeners)<K>(

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method allows mapping over the stream. The *fn* function will be called for every chunk in the stream. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed before being passed to the result stream.

    @param fn

    a function to map over every chunk in the stream. Async or not.

    ```
  + [read](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherGCM/read)(

    size?: number

    ): any;

    The `readable.read()` method reads data out of the internal buffer and returns it. If no data is available to be read, `null` is returned. By default, the data is returned as a `Buffer` object unless an encoding has been specified using the `readable.setEncoding()` method or the stream is operating in object mode.

    The optional `size` argument specifies a specific number of bytes to read. If `size` bytes are not available to be read, `null` will be returned *unless* the stream has ended, in which case all of the data remaining in the internal buffer will be returned.

    If the `size` argument is not specified, all of the data contained in the internal buffer will be returned.

    The `size` argument must be less than or equal to 1 GiB.

    The `readable.read()` method should only be called on `Readable` streams operating in paused mode. In flowing mode, `readable.read()` is called automatically until the internal buffer is fully drained.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();

    // 'readable' may be triggered multiple times as data is buffered in
    readable.on('readable', () => {
      let chunk;
      console.log('Stream is readable (new data received in buffer)');
      // Use a loop to make sure we read all currently available data
      while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
        console.log(`Read ${chunk.length} bytes of data...`);
      }
    });

    // 'end' will be triggered once when there is no more data available
    readable.on('end', () => {
      console.log('Reached end of stream.');
    });
    ```

    Each call to `readable.read()` returns a chunk of data, or `null`. The chunks are not concatenated. A `while` loop is necessary to consume all data currently in the buffer. When reading a large file `.read()` may return `null`, having consumed all buffered content so far, but there is still more data to come not yet buffered. In this case a new `'readable'` event will be emitted when there is more data in the buffer. Finally the `'end'` event will be emitted when there is no more data to come.

    Therefore to read a file's whole contents from a `readable`, it is necessary to collect chunks across multiple `'readable'` events:

    ```
    const chunks = [];

    readable.on('readable', () => {
      let chunk;
      while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
        chunks.push(chunk);
      }
    });

    readable.on('end', () => {
      const content = chunks.join('');
    });
    ```

    A `Readable` stream in object mode will always return a single item from a call to `readable.read(size)`, regardless of the value of the `size` argument.

    If the `readable.read()` method returns a chunk of data, a `'data'` event will also be emitted.

    Calling read after the `'end'` event has been emitted will return `null`. No runtime error will be raised.

    @param size

    Optional argument to specify how much data to read.
  + [reduce](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherGCM/reduce)<T = any>(

    initial?: undefined,

    options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>

    ): Promise<T>;

    This method calls *fn* on each chunk of the stream in order, passing it the result from the calculation on the previous element. It returns a promise for the final value of the reduction.

    If no *initial* value is supplied the first chunk of the stream is used as the initial value. If the stream is empty, the promise is rejected with a `TypeError` with the `ERR_INVALID_ARGS` code property.

    The reducer function iterates the stream element-by-element which means that there is no *concurrency* parameter or parallelism. To perform a reduce concurrently, you can extract the async function to `readable.map` method.

    @param fn

    a reducer function to call over every chunk in the stream. Async or not.

    @param initial

    the initial value to use in the reduction.

    @returns

    a promise for the final value of the reduction.

    ): Promise<T>;

    This method calls *fn* on each chunk of the stream in order, passing it the result from the calculation on the previous element. It returns a promise for the final value of the reduction.

  + [removeAllListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherGCM/removeAllListeners)(

    eventName?: string | symbol

    ): this;

    Removes all listeners, or those of the specified `eventName`.

    It is bad practice to remove listeners added elsewhere in the code, particularly when the `EventEmitter` instance was created by some other component or module (e.g. sockets or file streams).

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [removeListener](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherGCM/removeListener)(

    event: 'close',

    listener: () => void

    ): this;

    Removes the specified `listener` from the listener array for the event named `eventName`.

    ```
    const callback = (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    };
    server.on('connection', callback);
    // ...
    server.removeListener('connection', callback);
    ```

    `removeListener()` will remove, at most, one instance of a listener from the listener array. If any single listener has been added multiple times to the listener array for the specified `eventName`, then `removeListener()` must be called multiple times to remove each instance.

    Once an event is emitted, all listeners attached to it at the time of emitting are called in order. This implies that any `removeListener()` or `removeAllListeners()` calls *after* emitting and *before* the last listener finishes execution will not remove them from`emit()` in progress. Subsequent events behave as expected.

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}
    const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

    const callbackA = () => {
      console.log('A');
      myEmitter.removeListener('event', callbackB);
    };

    const callbackB = () => {
      console.log('B');
    };

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackA);

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackB);

    // callbackA removes listener callbackB but it will still be called.
    // Internal listener array at time of emit [callbackA, callbackB]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    //   B

    // callbackB is now removed.
    // Internal listener array [callbackA]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    ```

    Because listeners are managed using an internal array, calling this will change the position indices of any listener registered *after* the listener being removed. This will not impact the order in which listeners are called, but it means that any copies of the listener array as returned by the `emitter.listeners()` method will need to be recreated.

    When a single function has been added as a handler multiple times for a single event (as in the example below), `removeListener()` will remove the most recently added instance. In the example the `once('ping')` listener is removed:

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const ee = new EventEmitter();

    function pong() {
      console.log('pong');
    }

    ee.on('ping', pong);
    ee.once('ping', pong);
    ee.removeListener('ping', pong);

    ee.emit('ping');
    ee.emit('ping');
    ```

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

        console.log('Reached the end, but did not read anything.');

    When `autoPadding` is `false`, the length of the entire input data must be a multiple of the cipher's block size or `cipher.final()` will throw an error. Disabling automatic padding is useful for non-standard padding, for instance using `0x0` instead of PKCS padding.

    The `cipher.setAutoPadding()` method must be called before `cipher.final()`.

    @returns

  + [setDefaultEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherGCM/setDefaultEncoding)(

    encoding: BufferEncoding

    ): this;

    The `writable.setDefaultEncoding()` method sets the default `encoding` for a `Writable` stream.

    @param encoding

    The new default encoding
  + [setEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherGCM/setEncoding)(

    encoding: BufferEncoding

    ): this;

    The `readable.setEncoding()` method sets the character encoding for data read from the `Readable` stream.

    By default, no encoding is assigned and stream data will be returned as `Buffer` objects. Setting an encoding causes the stream data to be returned as strings of the specified encoding rather than as `Buffer` objects. For instance, calling `readable.setEncoding('utf8')` will cause the output data to be interpreted as UTF-8 data, and passed as strings. Calling `readable.setEncoding('hex')` will cause the data to be encoded in hexadecimal string format.

    The `Readable` stream will properly handle multi-byte characters delivered through the stream that would otherwise become improperly decoded if simply pulled from the stream as `Buffer` objects.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
    readable.setEncoding('utf8');
    readable.on('data', (chunk) => {
      assert.equal(typeof chunk, 'string');
      console.log('Got %d characters of string data:', chunk.length);
    });
    ```

    @param encoding

    The encoding to use.
  + [setMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherGCM/setMaxListeners)(

    n: number

    ): this;

    By default `EventEmitter`s will print a warning if more than `10` listeners are added for a particular event. This is a useful default that helps finding memory leaks. The `emitter.setMaxListeners()` method allows the limit to be modified for this specific `EventEmitter` instance. The value can be set to `Infinity` (or `0`) to indicate an unlimited number of listeners.

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [some](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherGCM/some)(

    fn: (data: any, options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>) => boolean | Promise<boolean>,

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<boolean>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.some` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream until the awaited return value is `true` (or any truthy value). Once an *fn* call on a chunk `await`ed return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with `true`. If none of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a truthy value, the promise is fulfilled with `false`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise evaluating to `true` if *fn* returned a truthy value for at least one of the chunks.
  + [take](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherGCM/take)(

    limit: number,

    options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method returns a new stream with the first *limit* chunks.

    @param limit

    the number of chunks to take from the readable.

    @returns

    a stream with *limit* chunks taken.
  + [toArray](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherGCM/toArray)(

    options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>

    ): Promise<any[]>;

    This method allows easily obtaining the contents of a stream.

    As this method reads the entire stream into memory, it negates the benefits of streams. It's intended for interoperability and convenience, not as the primary way to consume streams.

    @returns

    a promise containing an array with the contents of the stream.
  + [uncork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherGCM/uncork)(): void;

    The `writable.uncork()` method flushes all data buffered since cork was called.

    When using `writable.cork()` and `writable.uncork()` to manage the buffering of writes to a stream, defer calls to `writable.uncork()` using `process.nextTick()`. Doing so allows batching of all `writable.write()` calls that occur within a given Node.js event loop phase.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => stream.uncork());
    ```

    If the `writable.cork()` method is called multiple times on a stream, the same number of calls to `writable.uncork()` must be called to flush the buffered data.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => {
      stream.uncork();
      // The data will not be flushed until uncork() is called a second time.
      stream.uncork();
    });
    ```

    See also: `writable.cork()`.
  + [unpipe](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherGCM/unpipe)(

    destination?: WritableStream

    ): this;

    The `readable.unpipe()` method detaches a `Writable` stream previously attached using the pipe method.

    If the `destination` is not specified, then *all* pipes are detached.

    If the `destination` is specified, but no pipe is set up for it, then the method does nothing.

    ```
    import fs from 'node:fs';
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
    const writable = fs.createWriteStream('file.txt');
    // All the data from readable goes into 'file.txt',
    // but only for the first second.
    readable.pipe(writable);
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Stop writing to file.txt.');
      readable.unpipe(writable);
      console.log('Manually close the file stream.');
      writable.end();
    }, 1000);
    ```

    @param destination

    Optional specific stream to unpipe
  + [unshift](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherGCM/unshift)(

    chunk: any,

    encoding?: BufferEncoding

    ): void;

    Passing `chunk` as `null` signals the end of the stream (EOF) and behaves the same as `readable.push(null)`, after which no more data can be written. The EOF signal is put at the end of the buffer and any buffered data will still be flushed.

    The `readable.unshift()` method pushes a chunk of data back into the internal buffer. This is useful in certain situations where a stream is being consumed by code that needs to "un-consume" some amount of data that it has optimistically pulled out of the source, so that the data can be passed on to some other party.

    The `stream.unshift(chunk)` method cannot be called after the `'end'` event has been emitted or a runtime error will be thrown.

    Developers using `stream.unshift()` often should consider switching to use of a `Transform` stream instead. See the `API for stream implementers` section for more information.

    ```
    // Pull off a header delimited by \n\n.
    // Use unshift() if we get too much.
    // Call the callback with (error, header, stream).
    import { StringDecoder } from 'node:string_decoder';
    function parseHeader(stream, callback) {
      stream.on('error', callback);
      stream.on('readable', onReadable);
      const decoder = new StringDecoder('utf8');
      let header = '';
      function onReadable() {
        let chunk;
        while (null !== (chunk = stream.read())) {
          const str = decoder.write(chunk);
          if (str.includes('\n\n')) {
            // Found the header boundary.
            const split = str.split(/\n\n/);
            header += split.shift();
            const remaining = split.join('\n\n');
            const buf = Buffer.from(remaining, 'utf8');
            stream.removeListener('error', callback);
            // Remove the 'readable' listener before unshifting.
            stream.removeListener('readable', onReadable);
            if (buf.length)
              stream.unshift(buf);
            // Now the body of the message can be read from the stream.
            callback(null, header, stream);
            return;
          }
          // Still reading the header.
          header += str;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Unlike push, `stream.unshift(chunk)` will not end the reading process by resetting the internal reading state of the stream. This can cause unexpected results if `readable.unshift()` is called during a read (i.e. from within a \_read implementation on a custom stream). Following the call to `readable.unshift()` with an immediate push will reset the reading state appropriately, however it is best to simply avoid calling `readable.unshift()` while in the process of performing a read.

    @param chunk

    Chunk of data to unshift onto the read queue. For streams not operating in object mode, `chunk` must be a {string}, {Buffer}, {TypedArray}, {DataView} or `null`. For object mode streams, `chunk` may be any JavaScript value.

    @param encoding

    Encoding of string chunks. Must be a valid `Buffer` encoding, such as `'utf8'` or `'ascii'`.

  + [wrap](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherGCM/wrap)(

    stream: ReadableStream

    ): this;

    Prior to Node.js 0.10, streams did not implement the entire `node:stream` module API as it is currently defined. (See `Compatibility` for more information.)

    When using an older Node.js library that emits `'data'` events and has a pause method that is advisory only, the `readable.wrap()` method can be used to create a `Readable` stream that uses the old stream as its data source.

    It will rarely be necessary to use `readable.wrap()` but the method has been provided as a convenience for interacting with older Node.js applications and libraries.

    ```
    import { OldReader } from './old-api-module.js';
    import { Readable } from 'node:stream';
    const oreader = new OldReader();
    const myReader = new Readable().wrap(oreader);

    myReader.on('readable', () => {
      myReader.read(); // etc.
    });
    ```

  + [write](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherGCM/write)(

    chunk: any,

    callback?: (error: undefined | null | [Error](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Error)) => void

    ): boolean;

    The `writable.write()` method writes some data to the stream, and calls the supplied `callback` once the data has been fully handled. If an error occurs, the `callback` will be called with the error as its first argument. The `callback` is called asynchronously and before `'error'` is emitted.

    The return value is `true` if the internal buffer is less than the `highWaterMark` configured when the stream was created after admitting `chunk`. If `false` is returned, further attempts to write data to the stream should stop until the `'drain'` event is emitted.

    While a stream is not draining, calls to `write()` will buffer `chunk`, and return false. Once all currently buffered chunks are drained (accepted for delivery by the operating system), the `'drain'` event will be emitted. Once `write()` returns false, do not write more chunks until the `'drain'` event is emitted. While calling `write()` on a stream that is not draining is allowed, Node.js will buffer all written chunks until maximum memory usage occurs, at which point it will abort unconditionally. Even before it aborts, high memory usage will cause poor garbage collector performance and high RSS (which is not typically released back to the system, even after the memory is no longer required). Since TCP sockets may never drain if the remote peer does not read the data, writing a socket that is not draining may lead to a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

    Writing data while the stream is not draining is particularly problematic for a `Transform`, because the `Transform` streams are paused by default until they are piped or a `'data'` or `'readable'` event handler is added.

    If the data to be written can be generated or fetched on demand, it is recommended to encapsulate the logic into a `Readable` and use pipe. However, if calling `write()` is preferred, it is possible to respect backpressure and avoid memory issues using the `'drain'` event:

    ```
    function write(data, cb) {
      if (!stream.write(data)) {
        stream.once('drain', cb);
      } else {
        process.nextTick(cb);
      }
    }

    // Wait for cb to be called before doing any other write.
    write('hello', () => {
      console.log('Write completed, do more writes now.');
    });
    ```

    A `Writable` stream in object mode will always ignore the `encoding` argument.

    @returns

    `false` if the stream wishes for the calling code to wait for the `'drain'` event to be emitted before continuing to write additional data; otherwise `true`.

    chunk: any,

* ### interface [CipherOCB](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB)

  Instances of the `Cipheriv` class are used to encrypt data. The class can be used in one of two ways:

  + As a `stream` that is both readable and writable, where plain unencrypted data is written to produce encrypted data on the readable side, or
  + Using the `cipher.update()` and `cipher.final()` methods to produce the encrypted data.

  The createCipheriv method is used to create `Cipheriv` instances. `Cipheriv` objects are not to be created directly using the `new` keyword.

  Example: Using `Cipheriv` objects as streams:

  ```
  const {
    scrypt,
    randomFill,
    createCipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';

  // First, we'll generate the key. The key length is dependent on the algorithm.
  // In this case for aes192, it is 24 bytes (192 bits).
  scrypt(password, 'salt', 24, (err, key) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    // Then, we'll generate a random initialization vector
    randomFill(new Uint8Array(16), (err, iv) => {
      if (err) throw err;

      // Once we have the key and iv, we can create and use the cipher...
      const cipher = createCipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

      let encrypted = '';
      cipher.setEncoding('hex');

      cipher.on('data', (chunk) => encrypted += chunk);
      cipher.on('end', () => console.log(encrypted));

      cipher.write('some clear text data');
      cipher.end();
    });
  });
  ```

  Example: Using `Cipheriv` and piped streams:

  ```

  + [allowHalfOpen](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/allowHalfOpen): boolean

    If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`.

    This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing `Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
  + readonly [closed](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/closed): boolean

    Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
  + [destroyed](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/destroyed): boolean

  + readonly [errored](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/errored): null | [Error](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Error)

    Returns error if the stream has been destroyed with an error.
  + [readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/readable): boolean

    Is `true` if it is safe to call read, which means the stream has not been destroyed or emitted `'error'` or `'end'`.
  + readonly [readableAborted](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/readableAborted): boolean

    Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'end'`.

    Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
  + readonly [writable](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/writable): boolean

    Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
  + readonly [writableAborted](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/writableAborted): boolean

    Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'finish'`.
  + readonly [writableCorked](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/writableCorked): number

    Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
  + readonly [writableEnded](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/writableEnded): boolean

    Is `true` after `writable.end()` has been called. This property does not indicate whether the data has been flushed, for this use `writable.writableFinished` instead.

    This method returns a new stream with chunks of the underlying stream paired with a counter in the form `[index, chunk]`. The first index value is `0` and it increases by 1 for each chunk produced.

  + [cork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/cork)(): void;

    The `writable.cork()` method forces all written data to be buffered in memory. The buffered data will be flushed when either the uncork or end methods are called.

    The primary intent of `writable.cork()` is to accommodate a situation in which several small chunks are written to the stream in rapid succession. Instead of immediately forwarding them to the underlying destination, `writable.cork()` buffers all the chunks until `writable.uncork()` is called, which will pass them all to `writable._writev()`, if present. This prevents a head-of-line blocking situation where data is being buffered while waiting for the first small chunk to be processed. However, use of `writable.cork()` without implementing `writable._writev()` may have an adverse effect on throughput.

    See also: `writable.uncork()`, `writable._writev()`.

    Destroy the stream. Optionally emit an `'error'` event, and emit a `'close'` event (unless `emitClose` is set to `false`). After this call, the readable stream will release any internal resources and subsequent calls to `push()` will be ignored.

    Once `destroy()` has been called any further calls will be a no-op and no further errors except from `_destroy()` may be emitted as `'error'`.

    Implementors should not override this method, but instead implement `readable._destroy()`.

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method allows filtering the stream. For each chunk in the stream the *fn* function will be called and if it returns a truthy value, the chunk will be passed to the result stream. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed.

    @param fn

    a function to filter chunks from the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a stream filtered with the predicate *fn*.
  + [final](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/final)(): NonSharedBuffer;

    Once the `cipher.final()` method has been called, the `Cipheriv` object can no longer be used to encrypt data. Attempts to call `cipher.final()` more than once will result in an error being thrown.

    @returns

    Any remaining enciphered contents. If `outputEncoding` is specified, a string is returned. If an `outputEncoding` is not provided, a Buffer is returned.

    [final](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/final)(

    ): string;

    Once the `cipher.final()` method has been called, the `Cipheriv` object can no longer be used to encrypt data. Attempts to call `cipher.final()` more than once will result in an error being thrown.

    @param outputEncoding

    The `encoding` of the return value.

    @returns

    Any remaining enciphered contents. If `outputEncoding` is specified, a string is returned. If an `outputEncoding` is not provided, a Buffer is returned.

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<undefined | T>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.find` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream to find a chunk with a truthy value for *fn*. Once an *fn* call's awaited return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with value for which *fn* returned a truthy value. If all of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a falsy value, the promise is fulfilled with `undefined`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise evaluating to the first chunk for which *fn* evaluated with a truthy value, or `undefined` if no element was found.

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method returns a new stream by applying the given callback to each chunk of the stream and then flattening the result.

    It is possible to return a stream or another iterable or async iterable from *fn* and the result streams will be merged (flattened) into the returned stream.

    @param fn

    a function to map over every chunk in the stream. May be async. May be a stream or generator.

    @returns

    a stream flat-mapped with the function *fn*.

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<void>;

    This method allows iterating a stream. For each chunk in the stream the *fn* function will be called. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed.

    This method is different from `for await...of` loops in that it can optionally process chunks concurrently. In addition, a `forEach` iteration can only be stopped by having passed a `signal` option and aborting the related AbortController while `for await...of` can be stopped with `break` or `return`. In either case the stream will be destroyed.

    This method is different from listening to the `'data'` event in that it uses the `readable` event in the underlying machinary and can limit the number of concurrent *fn* calls.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise for when the stream has finished.
  + [getAuthTag](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/getAuthTag)(): NonSharedBuffer;

  + [isPaused](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/isPaused)(): boolean;

    The `readable.isPaused()` method returns the current operating state of the `Readable`. This is used primarily by the mechanism that underlies the `readable.pipe()` method. In most typical cases, there will be no reason to use this method directly.

    ```
    const readable = new stream.Readable();

    readable.isPaused(); // === false
    readable.pause();
    readable.isPaused(); // === true
    readable.resume();
    readable.isPaused(); // === false
    ```
  + [iterator](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/iterator)(

    options?: { destroyOnReturn: boolean }

    ): AsyncIterator<any>;

    The iterator created by this method gives users the option to cancel the destruction of the stream if the `for await...of` loop is exited by `return`, `break`, or `throw`, or if the iterator should destroy the stream if the stream emitted an error during iteration.

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method allows mapping over the stream. The *fn* function will be called for every chunk in the stream. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed before being passed to the result stream.

    event: 'close',

    listener: () => void

    ): this;

    Adds the `listener` function to the end of the listeners array for the event named `eventName`. No checks are made to see if the `listener` has already been added. Multiple calls passing the same combination of `eventName` and `listener` will result in the `listener` being added, and called, multiple times.

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

    By default, event listeners are invoked in the order they are added. The `emitter.prependListener()` method can be used as an alternative to add the event listener to the beginning of the listeners array.

  + [read](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/read)(

    size?: number

    ): any;

    The `readable.read()` method reads data out of the internal buffer and returns it. If no data is available to be read, `null` is returned. By default, the data is returned as a `Buffer` object unless an encoding has been specified using the `readable.setEncoding()` method or the stream is operating in object mode.

    The optional `size` argument specifies a specific number of bytes to read. If `size` bytes are not available to be read, `null` will be returned *unless* the stream has ended, in which case all of the data remaining in the internal buffer will be returned.

    If the `size` argument is not specified, all of the data contained in the internal buffer will be returned.

    The `size` argument must be less than or equal to 1 GiB.

    The `readable.read()` method should only be called on `Readable` streams operating in paused mode. In flowing mode, `readable.read()` is called automatically until the internal buffer is fully drained.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();

    // 'readable' may be triggered multiple times as data is buffered in
    readable.on('readable', () => {
      let chunk;
      console.log('Stream is readable (new data received in buffer)');
      // Use a loop to make sure we read all currently available data
      while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
        console.log(`Read ${chunk.length} bytes of data...`);
      }
    });

    // 'end' will be triggered once when there is no more data available
    readable.on('end', () => {
      console.log('Reached end of stream.');
    });
    ```

    Each call to `readable.read()` returns a chunk of data, or `null`. The chunks are not concatenated. A `while` loop is necessary to consume all data currently in the buffer. When reading a large file `.read()` may return `null`, having consumed all buffered content so far, but there is still more data to come not yet buffered. In this case a new `'readable'` event will be emitted when there is more data in the buffer. Finally the `'end'` event will be emitted when there is no more data to come.

    Therefore to read a file's whole contents from a `readable`, it is necessary to collect chunks across multiple `'readable'` events:

    ```
    const chunks = [];

    readable.on('readable', () => {
      let chunk;
      while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
        chunks.push(chunk);
      }
    });

    readable.on('end', () => {
      const content = chunks.join('');
    });
    ```

    A `Readable` stream in object mode will always return a single item from a call to `readable.read(size)`, regardless of the value of the `size` argument.

    If the `readable.read()` method returns a chunk of data, a `'data'` event will also be emitted.

    Calling read after the `'end'` event has been emitted will return `null`. No runtime error will be raised.

    This method calls *fn* on each chunk of the stream in order, passing it the result from the calculation on the previous element. It returns a promise for the final value of the reduction.

    If no *initial* value is supplied the first chunk of the stream is used as the initial value. If the stream is empty, the promise is rejected with a `TypeError` with the `ERR_INVALID_ARGS` code property.

    The reducer function iterates the stream element-by-element which means that there is no *concurrency* parameter or parallelism. To perform a reduce concurrently, you can extract the async function to `readable.map` method.

    @param fn

    a reducer function to call over every chunk in the stream. Async or not.

  + [removeAllListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/removeAllListeners)(

    eventName?: string | symbol

    ): this;

    Removes all listeners, or those of the specified `eventName`.

    It is bad practice to remove listeners added elsewhere in the code, particularly when the `EventEmitter` instance was created by some other component or module (e.g. sockets or file streams).

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [removeListener](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/removeListener)(

    event: 'close',

    listener: () => void

    ): this;

    Removes the specified `listener` from the listener array for the event named `eventName`.

    ```
    const callback = (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    };
    server.on('connection', callback);
    // ...
    server.removeListener('connection', callback);
    ```

    `removeListener()` will remove, at most, one instance of a listener from the listener array. If any single listener has been added multiple times to the listener array for the specified `eventName`, then `removeListener()` must be called multiple times to remove each instance.

    Once an event is emitted, all listeners attached to it at the time of emitting are called in order. This implies that any `removeListener()` or `removeAllListeners()` calls *after* emitting and *before* the last listener finishes execution will not remove them from`emit()` in progress. Subsequent events behave as expected.

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}
    const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

    const callbackA = () => {
      console.log('A');
      myEmitter.removeListener('event', callbackB);
    };

    const callbackB = () => {
      console.log('B');
    };

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackA);

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackB);

    // callbackA removes listener callbackB but it will still be called.
    // Internal listener array at time of emit [callbackA, callbackB]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    //   B

    // callbackB is now removed.
    // Internal listener array [callbackA]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    ```

    Because listeners are managed using an internal array, calling this will change the position indices of any listener registered *after* the listener being removed. This will not impact the order in which listeners are called, but it means that any copies of the listener array as returned by the `emitter.listeners()` method will need to be recreated.

    When a single function has been added as a handler multiple times for a single event (as in the example below), `removeListener()` will remove the most recently added instance. In the example the `once('ping')` listener is removed:

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const ee = new EventEmitter();

    function pong() {
      console.log('pong');
    }

    ee.on('ping', pong);
    ee.once('ping', pong);
    ee.removeListener('ping', pong);

    ee.emit('ping');
    ee.emit('ping');
    ```

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

  + [resume](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/resume)(): this;

    The `readable.resume()` method causes an explicitly paused `Readable` stream to resume emitting `'data'` events, switching the stream into flowing mode.

    The `readable.resume()` method can be used to fully consume the data from a stream without actually processing any of that data:

    ```
    getReadableStreamSomehow()
      .resume()
      .on('end', () => {
        console.log('Reached the end, but did not read anything.');
      });
    ```

    The `readable.resume()` method has no effect if there is a `'readable'` event listener.

    autoPadding?: boolean

    When using block encryption algorithms, the `Cipheriv` class will automatically add padding to the input data to the appropriate block size. To disable the default padding call `cipher.setAutoPadding(false)`.

    When `autoPadding` is `false`, the length of the entire input data must be a multiple of the cipher's block size or `cipher.final()` will throw an error. Disabling automatic padding is useful for non-standard padding, for instance using `0x0` instead of PKCS padding.

    The `cipher.setAutoPadding()` method must be called before `cipher.final()`.

    @returns

  + [setDefaultEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/setDefaultEncoding)(

    encoding: BufferEncoding

    ): this;

    The `writable.setDefaultEncoding()` method sets the default `encoding` for a `Writable` stream.

    @param encoding

    The new default encoding
  + [setEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/setEncoding)(

    encoding: BufferEncoding

    ): this;

    The `readable.setEncoding()` method sets the character encoding for data read from the `Readable` stream.

    By default, no encoding is assigned and stream data will be returned as `Buffer` objects. Setting an encoding causes the stream data to be returned as strings of the specified encoding rather than as `Buffer` objects. For instance, calling `readable.setEncoding('utf8')` will cause the output data to be interpreted as UTF-8 data, and passed as strings. Calling `readable.setEncoding('hex')` will cause the data to be encoded in hexadecimal string format.

    The `Readable` stream will properly handle multi-byte characters delivered through the stream that would otherwise become improperly decoded if simply pulled from the stream as `Buffer` objects.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
    readable.setEncoding('utf8');
    readable.on('data', (chunk) => {
      assert.equal(typeof chunk, 'string');
      console.log('Got %d characters of string data:', chunk.length);

  + [setMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/setMaxListeners)(

    n: number

    ): this;

    By default `EventEmitter`s will print a warning if more than `10` listeners are added for a particular event. This is a useful default that helps finding memory leaks. The `emitter.setMaxListeners()` method allows the limit to be modified for this specific `EventEmitter` instance. The value can be set to `Infinity` (or `0`) to indicate an unlimited number of listeners.

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [some](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/some)(

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<boolean>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.some` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream until the awaited return value is `true` (or any truthy value). Once an *fn* call on a chunk `await`ed return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with `true`. If none of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a truthy value, the promise is fulfilled with `false`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise evaluating to `true` if *fn* returned a truthy value for at least one of the chunks.

    This method returns a new stream with the first *limit* chunks.

    @param limit

    the number of chunks to take from the readable.

    @returns

    a stream with *limit* chunks taken.
  + [toArray](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/toArray)(

    options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>

    ): Promise<any[]>;

    This method allows easily obtaining the contents of a stream.

    As this method reads the entire stream into memory, it negates the benefits of streams. It's intended for interoperability and convenience, not as the primary way to consume streams.

    @returns

    a promise containing an array with the contents of the stream.
  + [uncork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/uncork)(): void;

    The `writable.uncork()` method flushes all data buffered since cork was called.

    When using `writable.cork()` and `writable.uncork()` to manage the buffering of writes to a stream, defer calls to `writable.uncork()` using `process.nextTick()`. Doing so allows batching of all `writable.write()` calls that occur within a given Node.js event loop phase.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => stream.uncork());
    ```

    If the `writable.cork()` method is called multiple times on a stream, the same number of calls to `writable.uncork()` must be called to flush the buffered data.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => {
      stream.uncork();
      // The data will not be flushed until uncork() is called a second time.
      stream.uncork();
    });
    ```

    See also: `writable.cork()`.
  + [unpipe](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/unpipe)(

    destination?: WritableStream

    ): this;

    The `readable.unpipe()` method detaches a `Writable` stream previously attached using the pipe method.

    If the `destination` is not specified, then *all* pipes are detached.

    If the `destination` is specified, but no pipe is set up for it, then the method does nothing.

    ```
    import fs from 'node:fs';
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
    const writable = fs.createWriteStream('file.txt');
    // All the data from readable goes into 'file.txt',
    // but only for the first second.
    readable.pipe(writable);
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Stop writing to file.txt.');
      readable.unpipe(writable);
      console.log('Manually close the file stream.');
      writable.end();
    }, 1000);
    ```

    @param destination

    Optional specific stream to unpipe
  + [unshift](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/unshift)(

    chunk: any,

    encoding?: BufferEncoding

    ): void;

    Passing `chunk` as `null` signals the end of the stream (EOF) and behaves the same as `readable.push(null)`, after which no more data can be written. The EOF signal is put at the end of the buffer and any buffered data will still be flushed.

    The `readable.unshift()` method pushes a chunk of data back into the internal buffer. This is useful in certain situations where a stream is being consumed by code that needs to "un-consume" some amount of data that it has optimistically pulled out of the source, so that the data can be passed on to some other party.

    The `stream.unshift(chunk)` method cannot be called after the `'end'` event has been emitted or a runtime error will be thrown.

    Developers using `stream.unshift()` often should consider switching to use of a `Transform` stream instead. See the `API for stream implementers` section for more information.

    ```
    // Pull off a header delimited by \n\n.
    // Use unshift() if we get too much.
    // Call the callback with (error, header, stream).
    import { StringDecoder } from 'node:string_decoder';
    function parseHeader(stream, callback) {
      stream.on('error', callback);
      stream.on('readable', onReadable);
      const decoder = new StringDecoder('utf8');
      let header = '';
      function onReadable() {
        let chunk;
        while (null !== (chunk = stream.read())) {
          const str = decoder.write(chunk);
          if (str.includes('\n\n')) {
            // Found the header boundary.
            const split = str.split(/\n\n/);
            header += split.shift();
            const remaining = split.join('\n\n');
            const buf = Buffer.from(remaining, 'utf8');
            stream.removeListener('error', callback);
            // Remove the 'readable' listener before unshifting.
            stream.removeListener('readable', onReadable);
            if (buf.length)
              stream.unshift(buf);
            // Now the body of the message can be read from the stream.
            callback(null, header, stream);
            return;
          }
          // Still reading the header.
          header += str;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Unlike push, `stream.unshift(chunk)` will not end the reading process by resetting the internal reading state of the stream. This can cause unexpected results if `readable.unshift()` is called during a read (i.e. from within a \_read implementation on a custom stream). Following the call to `readable.unshift()` with an immediate push will reset the reading state appropriately, however it is best to simply avoid calling `readable.unshift()` while in the process of performing a read.

    @param chunk

    Chunk of data to unshift onto the read queue. For streams not operating in object mode, `chunk` must be a {string}, {Buffer}, {TypedArray}, {DataView} or `null`. For object mode streams, `chunk` may be any JavaScript value.

  + [wrap](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/wrap)(

    stream: ReadableStream

    ): this;

    Prior to Node.js 0.10, streams did not implement the entire `node:stream` module API as it is currently defined. (See `Compatibility` for more information.)

    When using an older Node.js library that emits `'data'` events and has a pause method that is advisory only, the `readable.wrap()` method can be used to create a `Readable` stream that uses the old stream as its data source.

    It will rarely be necessary to use `readable.wrap()` but the method has been provided as a convenience for interacting with older Node.js applications and libraries.

    ```
    import { OldReader } from './old-api-module.js';
    import { Readable } from 'node:stream';
    const oreader = new OldReader();
    const myReader = new Readable().wrap(oreader);

    myReader.on('readable', () => {
      myReader.read(); // etc.
    });
    ```

    @param stream

    An "old style" readable stream
  + [write](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/CipherOCB/write)(

    chunk: any,

    callback?: (error: undefined | null | [Error](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Error)) => void

    ): boolean;

    The `writable.write()` method writes some data to the stream, and calls the supplied `callback` once the data has been fully handled. If an error occurs, the `callback` will be called with the error as its first argument. The `callback` is called asynchronously and before `'error'` is emitted.

    The return value is `true` if the internal buffer is less than the `highWaterMark` configured when the stream was created after admitting `chunk`. If `false` is returned, further attempts to write data to the stream should stop until the `'drain'` event is emitted.

    While a stream is not draining, calls to `write()` will buffer `chunk`, and return false. Once all currently buffered chunks are drained (accepted for delivery by the operating system), the `'drain'` event will be emitted. Once `write()` returns false, do not write more chunks until the `'drain'` event is emitted. While calling `write()` on a stream that is not draining is allowed, Node.js will buffer all written chunks until maximum memory usage occurs, at which point it will abort unconditionally. Even before it aborts, high memory usage will cause poor garbage collector performance and high RSS (which is not typically released back to the system, even after the memory is no longer required). Since TCP sockets may never drain if the remote peer does not read the data, writing a socket that is not draining may lead to a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

    Writing data while the stream is not draining is particularly problematic for a `Transform`, because the `Transform` streams are paused by default until they are piped or a `'data'` or `'readable'` event handler is added.

    If the data to be written can be generated or fetched on demand, it is recommended to encapsulate the logic into a `Readable` and use pipe. However, if calling `write()` is preferred, it is possible to respect backpressure and avoid memory issues using the `'drain'` event:

    ```
    function write(data, cb) {
      if (!stream.write(data)) {
        stream.once('drain', cb);
      } else {
        process.nextTick(cb);
      }
    }

    // Wait for cb to be called before doing any other write.
    write('hello', () => {
      console.log('Write completed, do more writes now.');
    });
    ```

    A `Writable` stream in object mode will always ignore the `encoding` argument.

    @param chunk

    Optional data to write. For streams not operating in object mode, `chunk` must be a {string}, {Buffer}, {TypedArray} or {DataView}. For object mode streams, `chunk` may be any JavaScript value other than `null`.

    @param callback

    Callback for when this chunk of data is flushed.

    @returns

    `false` if the stream wishes for the calling code to wait for the `'drain'` event to be emitted before continuing to write additional data; otherwise `true`.

    The `writable.write()` method writes some data to the stream, and calls the supplied `callback` once the data has been fully handled. If an error occurs, the `callback` will be called with the error as its first argument. The `callback` is called asynchronously and before `'error'` is emitted.

    The return value is `true` if the internal buffer is less than the `highWaterMark` configured when the stream was created after admitting `chunk`. If `false` is returned, further attempts to write data to the stream should stop until the `'drain'` event is emitted.

    While a stream is not draining, calls to `write()` will buffer `chunk`, and return false. Once all currently buffered chunks are drained (accepted for delivery by the operating system), the `'drain'` event will be emitted. Once `write()` returns false, do not write more chunks until the `'drain'` event is emitted. While calling `write()` on a stream that is not draining is allowed, Node.js will buffer all written chunks until maximum memory usage occurs, at which point it will abort unconditionally. Even before it aborts, high memory usage will cause poor garbage collector performance and high RSS (which is not typically released back to the system, even after the memory is no longer required). Since TCP sockets may never drain if the remote peer does not read the data, writing a socket that is not draining may lead to a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

    Writing data while the stream is not draining is particularly problematic for a `Transform`, because the `Transform` streams are paused by default until they are piped or a `'data'` or `'readable'` event handler is added.

    If the data to be written can be generated or fetched on demand, it is recommended to encapsulate the logic into a `Readable` and use pipe. However, if calling `write()` is preferred, it is possible to respect backpressure and avoid memory issues using the `'drain'` event:

    ```
    function write(data, cb) {
      if (!stream.write(data)) {
        stream.once('drain', cb);
      } else {
        process.nextTick(cb);
      }
    }

    // Wait for cb to be called before doing any other write.
    write('hello', () => {
      console.log('Write completed, do more writes now.');
    });
    ```

    A `Writable` stream in object mode will always ignore the `encoding` argument.

    @param chunk

    Optional data to write. For streams not operating in object mode, `chunk` must be a {string}, {Buffer}, {TypedArray} or {DataView}. For object mode streams, `chunk` may be any JavaScript value other than `null`.

    @param encoding

    The encoding, if `chunk` is a string.

    @param callback

    Callback for when this chunk of data is flushed.

    @returns

    `false` if the stream wishes for the calling code to wait for the `'drain'` event to be emitted before continuing to write additional data; otherwise `true`.

* ### interface [DecipherCCM](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM)

  Instances of the `Decipheriv` class are used to decrypt data. The class can be used in one of two ways:

  + As a `stream` that is both readable and writable, where plain encrypted data is written to produce unencrypted data on the readable side, or
  + Using the `decipher.update()` and `decipher.final()` methods to produce the unencrypted data.

  The createDecipheriv method is used to create `Decipheriv` instances. `Decipheriv` objects are not to be created directly using the `new` keyword.

  Example: Using `Decipheriv` objects as streams:

  ```
  import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';
  const {
    scryptSync,
    createDecipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';
  // Key length is dependent on the algorithm. In this case for aes192, it is
  // 24 bytes (192 bits).
  // Use the async `crypto.scrypt()` instead.
  const key = scryptSync(password, 'salt', 24);
  // The IV is usually passed along with the ciphertext.
  const iv = Buffer.alloc(16, 0); // Initialization vector.

  const decipher = createDecipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

  let decrypted = '';
  decipher.on('readable', () => {
    let chunk;
    while (null !== (chunk = decipher.read())) {
      decrypted += chunk.toString('utf8');
    }
  });
  decipher.on('end', () => {
    console.log(decrypted);
    // Prints: some clear text data
  });

  // Encrypted with same algorithm, key and iv.
  const encrypted =
    'e5f79c5915c02171eec6b212d5520d44480993d7d622a7c4c2da32f6efda0ffa';
  decipher.write(encrypted, 'hex');
  decipher.end();
  ```

  Example: Using `Decipheriv` and piped streams:

  ```
  import {
    createReadStream,
    createWriteStream,
  } from 'node:fs';
  import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';
  const {
    scryptSync,
    createDecipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';
  // Use the async `crypto.scrypt()` instead.
  const key = scryptSync(password, 'salt', 24);
  // The IV is usually passed along with the ciphertext.
  const iv = Buffer.alloc(16, 0); // Initialization vector.

  const decipher = createDecipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

  const input = createReadStream('test.enc');
  const output = createWriteStream('test.js');

  input.pipe(decipher).pipe(output);
  ```

  Example: Using the `decipher.update()` and `decipher.final()` methods:

  ```
  import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';
  const {
    scryptSync,
    createDecipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';
  // Use the async `crypto.scrypt()` instead.
  const key = scryptSync(password, 'salt', 24);
  // The IV is usually passed along with the ciphertext.
  const iv = Buffer.alloc(16, 0); // Initialization vector.

  const decipher = createDecipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

  // Encrypted using same algorithm, key and iv.
  const encrypted =
    'e5f79c5915c02171eec6b212d5520d44480993d7d622a7c4c2da32f6efda0ffa';
  let decrypted = decipher.update(encrypted, 'hex', 'utf8');
  decrypted += decipher.final('utf8');
  console.log(decrypted);
  // Prints: some clear text data
  ```

    The `writable.cork()` method forces all written data to be buffered in memory. The buffered data will be flushed when either the uncork or end methods are called.

    The primary intent of `writable.cork()` is to accommodate a situation in which several small chunks are written to the stream in rapid succession. Instead of immediately forwarding them to the underlying destination, `writable.cork()` buffers all the chunks until `writable.uncork()` is called, which will pass them all to `writable._writev()`, if present. This prevents a head-of-line blocking situation where data is being buffered while waiting for the first small chunk to be processed. However, use of `writable.cork()` without implementing `writable._writev()` may have an adverse effect on throughput.

    See also: `writable.uncork()`, `writable._writev()`.

    Once `destroy()` has been called any further calls will be a no-op and no further errors except from `_destroy()` may be emitted as `'error'`.

    Implementors should not override this method, but instead implement `readable._destroy()`.

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<boolean>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.every` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream to check if all awaited return values are truthy value for *fn*. Once an *fn* call on a chunk `await`ed return value is falsy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with `false`. If all of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a truthy value, the promise is fulfilled with `true`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise evaluating to `true` if *fn* returned a truthy value for every one of the chunks.

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method allows filtering the stream. For each chunk in the stream the *fn* function will be called and if it returns a truthy value, the chunk will be passed to the result stream. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed.

    @param fn

    a function to filter chunks from the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a stream filtered with the predicate *fn*.
  + [final](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM/final)(): NonSharedBuffer;

    Once the `decipher.final()` method has been called, the `Decipheriv` object can no longer be used to decrypt data. Attempts to call `decipher.final()` more than once will result in an error being thrown.

    @returns

    Any remaining deciphered contents. If `outputEncoding` is specified, a string is returned. If an `outputEncoding` is not provided, a Buffer is returned.

    [final](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM/final)(

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<undefined | T>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.find` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream to find a chunk with a truthy value for *fn*. Once an *fn* call's awaited return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with value for which *fn* returned a truthy value. If all of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a falsy value, the promise is fulfilled with `undefined`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise evaluating to the first chunk for which *fn* evaluated with a truthy value, or `undefined` if no element was found.

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.find` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream to find a chunk with a truthy value for *fn*. Once an *fn* call's awaited return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with value for which *fn* returned a truthy value. If all of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a falsy value, the promise is fulfilled with `undefined`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method returns a new stream by applying the given callback to each chunk of the stream and then flattening the result.

    It is possible to return a stream or another iterable or async iterable from *fn* and the result streams will be merged (flattened) into the returned stream.

    @param fn

    a function to map over every chunk in the stream. May be async. May be a stream or generator.

    @returns

    a stream flat-mapped with the function *fn*.
  + [forEach](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM/forEach)(

    fn: (data: any, options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>) => void | Promise<void>,

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<void>;

    This method allows iterating a stream. For each chunk in the stream the *fn* function will be called. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed.

    This method is different from `for await...of` loops in that it can optionally process chunks concurrently. In addition, a `forEach` iteration can only be stopped by having passed a `signal` option and aborting the related AbortController while `for await...of` can be stopped with `break` or `return`. In either case the stream will be destroyed.

    This method is different from listening to the `'data'` event in that it uses the `readable` event in the underlying machinary and can limit the number of concurrent *fn* calls.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise for when the stream has finished.
  + [getMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM/getMaxListeners)(): number;

    Returns the current max listener value for the `EventEmitter` which is either set by `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` or defaults to EventEmitter.defaultMaxListeners.
  + [isPaused](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM/isPaused)(): boolean;

    The `readable.isPaused()` method returns the current operating state of the `Readable`. This is used primarily by the mechanism that underlies the `readable.pipe()` method. In most typical cases, there will be no reason to use this method directly.

    ```
    const readable = new stream.Readable();

    readable.isPaused(); // === false
    readable.pause();
    readable.isPaused(); // === true
    readable.resume();
    readable.isPaused(); // === false
    ```
  + [iterator](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM/iterator)(

    options?: { destroyOnReturn: boolean }

    ): AsyncIterator<any>;

    The iterator created by this method gives users the option to cancel the destruction of the stream if the `for await...of` loop is exited by `return`, `break`, or `throw`, or if the iterator should destroy the stream if the stream emitted an error during iteration.
  + [listenerCount](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM/listenerCount)<K>(

    eventName: string | symbol,

    listener?: Function

    Returns the number of listeners listening for the event named `eventName`. If `listener` is provided, it will return how many times the listener is found in the list of the listeners of the event.

    @param eventName

    The name of the event being listened for

    @param listener

    The event handler function
  + [listeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM/listeners)<K>(

    eventName: string | symbol

    server.on('connection', (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    });
    console.log(util.inspect(server.listeners('connection')));

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method allows mapping over the stream. The *fn* function will be called for every chunk in the stream. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed before being passed to the result stream.

    @param fn

    a function to map over every chunk in the stream. Async or not.

  + [on](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM/on)(

    event: 'close',

    listener: () => void

    ): this;

    Adds the `listener` function to the end of the listeners array for the event named `eventName`. No checks are made to see if the `listener` has already been added. Multiple calls passing the same combination of `eventName` and `listener` will result in the `listener` being added, and called, multiple times.

    ```
    server.on('connection', (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    });
    ```

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

    By default, event listeners are invoked in the order they are added. The `emitter.prependListener()` method can be used as an alternative to add the event listener to the beginning of the listeners array.

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const myEE = new EventEmitter();
    myEE.on('foo', () => console.log('a'));
    myEE.prependListener('foo', () => console.log('b'));

    The `readable.pause()` method will cause a stream in flowing mode to stop emitting `'data'` events, switching out of flowing mode. Any data that becomes available will remain in the internal buffer.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();

    ```
  + [read](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM/read)(

    size?: number

    ): any;

    The `readable.read()` method reads data out of the internal buffer and returns it. If no data is available to be read, `null` is returned. By default, the data is returned as a `Buffer` object unless an encoding has been specified using the `readable.setEncoding()` method or the stream is operating in object mode.

    The optional `size` argument specifies a specific number of bytes to read. If `size` bytes are not available to be read, `null` will be returned *unless* the stream has ended, in which case all of the data remaining in the internal buffer will be returned.

    If the `size` argument is not specified, all of the data contained in the internal buffer will be returned.

    The `size` argument must be less than or equal to 1 GiB.

    The `readable.read()` method should only be called on `Readable` streams operating in paused mode. In flowing mode, `readable.read()` is called automatically until the internal buffer is fully drained.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();

    // 'readable' may be triggered multiple times as data is buffered in
    readable.on('readable', () => {
      let chunk;
      console.log('Stream is readable (new data received in buffer)');
      // Use a loop to make sure we read all currently available data
      while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
        console.log(`Read ${chunk.length} bytes of data...`);
      }
    });

    // 'end' will be triggered once when there is no more data available
    readable.on('end', () => {
      console.log('Reached end of stream.');
    });
    ```

    Each call to `readable.read()` returns a chunk of data, or `null`. The chunks are not concatenated. A `while` loop is necessary to consume all data currently in the buffer. When reading a large file `.read()` may return `null`, having consumed all buffered content so far, but there is still more data to come not yet buffered. In this case a new `'readable'` event will be emitted when there is more data in the buffer. Finally the `'end'` event will be emitted when there is no more data to come.

    Therefore to read a file's whole contents from a `readable`, it is necessary to collect chunks across multiple `'readable'` events:

    ```
    const chunks = [];

    readable.on('readable', () => {
      let chunk;
      while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
        chunks.push(chunk);
      }
    });

    readable.on('end', () => {
      const content = chunks.join('');
    });
    ```

    A `Readable` stream in object mode will always return a single item from a call to `readable.read(size)`, regardless of the value of the `size` argument.

    If the `readable.read()` method returns a chunk of data, a `'data'` event will also be emitted.

    Calling read after the `'end'` event has been emitted will return `null`. No runtime error will be raised.

    @param size

    Optional argument to specify how much data to read.

    initial?: undefined,

    options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>

    ): Promise<T>;

    This method calls *fn* on each chunk of the stream in order, passing it the result from the calculation on the previous element. It returns a promise for the final value of the reduction.

    If no *initial* value is supplied the first chunk of the stream is used as the initial value. If the stream is empty, the promise is rejected with a `TypeError` with the `ERR_INVALID_ARGS` code property.

    The reducer function iterates the stream element-by-element which means that there is no *concurrency* parameter or parallelism. To perform a reduce concurrently, you can extract the async function to `readable.map` method.

    @param fn

    a reducer function to call over every chunk in the stream. Async or not.

    @param initial

    the initial value to use in the reduction.

  + [removeAllListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM/removeAllListeners)(

    eventName?: string | symbol

    ): this;

    Removes all listeners, or those of the specified `eventName`.

    It is bad practice to remove listeners added elsewhere in the code, particularly when the `EventEmitter` instance was created by some other component or module (e.g. sockets or file streams).

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [removeListener](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM/removeListener)(

    event: 'close',

    listener: () => void

    ): this;

    Removes the specified `listener` from the listener array for the event named `eventName`.

    ```
    const callback = (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    };
    server.on('connection', callback);
    // ...
    server.removeListener('connection', callback);
    ```

    `removeListener()` will remove, at most, one instance of a listener from the listener array. If any single listener has been added multiple times to the listener array for the specified `eventName`, then `removeListener()` must be called multiple times to remove each instance.

    Once an event is emitted, all listeners attached to it at the time of emitting are called in order. This implies that any `removeListener()` or `removeAllListeners()` calls *after* emitting and *before* the last listener finishes execution will not remove them from`emit()` in progress. Subsequent events behave as expected.

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}
    const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

    const callbackA = () => {
      console.log('A');
      myEmitter.removeListener('event', callbackB);
    };

    const callbackB = () => {
      console.log('B');
    };

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackA);

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackB);

    // callbackA removes listener callbackB but it will still be called.
    // Internal listener array at time of emit [callbackA, callbackB]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    //   B

    // callbackB is now removed.
    // Internal listener array [callbackA]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    ```

    Because listeners are managed using an internal array, calling this will change the position indices of any listener registered *after* the listener being removed. This will not impact the order in which listeners are called, but it means that any copies of the listener array as returned by the `emitter.listeners()` method will need to be recreated.

    When a single function has been added as a handler multiple times for a single event (as in the example below), `removeListener()` will remove the most recently added instance. In the example the `once('ping')` listener is removed:

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const ee = new EventEmitter();

    function pong() {
      console.log('pong');
    }

    ee.on('ping', pong);
    ee.once('ping', pong);
    ee.removeListener('ping', pong);

    ee.emit('ping');
    ee.emit('ping');
    ```

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

  + [resume](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM/resume)(): this;

    The `readable.resume()` method causes an explicitly paused `Readable` stream to resume emitting `'data'` events, switching the stream into flowing mode.

    The `readable.resume()` method can be used to fully consume the data from a stream without actually processing any of that data:

    ```
    getReadableStreamSomehow()
      .resume()
      .on('end', () => {
        console.log('Reached the end, but did not read anything.');

    When data has been encrypted without standard block padding, calling `decipher.setAutoPadding(false)` will disable automatic padding to prevent `decipher.final()` from checking for and removing padding.

    Turning auto padding off will only work if the input data's length is a multiple of the ciphers block size.

    The `decipher.setAutoPadding()` method must be called before `decipher.final()`.

    @returns

    for method chaining.
  + [setDefaultEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM/setDefaultEncoding)(

    encoding: BufferEncoding

    ): this;

    The `writable.setDefaultEncoding()` method sets the default `encoding` for a `Writable` stream.

    @param encoding

    The new default encoding
  + [setEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM/setEncoding)(

    encoding: BufferEncoding

    ): this;

    The `readable.setEncoding()` method sets the character encoding for data read from the `Readable` stream.

    By default, no encoding is assigned and stream data will be returned as `Buffer` objects. Setting an encoding causes the stream data to be returned as strings of the specified encoding rather than as `Buffer` objects. For instance, calling `readable.setEncoding('utf8')` will cause the output data to be interpreted as UTF-8 data, and passed as strings. Calling `readable.setEncoding('hex')` will cause the data to be encoded in hexadecimal string format.

    The `Readable` stream will properly handle multi-byte characters delivered through the stream that would otherwise become improperly decoded if simply pulled from the stream as `Buffer` objects.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
    readable.setEncoding('utf8');
    readable.on('data', (chunk) => {
      assert.equal(typeof chunk, 'string');

  + [setMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM/setMaxListeners)(

    n: number

    ): this;

    By default `EventEmitter`s will print a warning if more than `10` listeners are added for a particular event. This is a useful default that helps finding memory leaks. The `emitter.setMaxListeners()` method allows the limit to be modified for this specific `EventEmitter` instance. The value can be set to `Infinity` (or `0`) to indicate an unlimited number of listeners.

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [some](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM/some)(

    fn: (data: any, options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>) => boolean | Promise<boolean>,

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<boolean>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.some` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream until the awaited return value is `true` (or any truthy value). Once an *fn* call on a chunk `await`ed return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with `true`. If none of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a truthy value, the promise is fulfilled with `false`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise evaluating to `true` if *fn* returned a truthy value for at least one of the chunks.

    This method returns a new stream with the first *limit* chunks.

    @param limit

    the number of chunks to take from the readable.

    @returns

    a stream with *limit* chunks taken.
  + [toArray](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM/toArray)(

    options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>

    ): Promise<any[]>;

    This method allows easily obtaining the contents of a stream.

    As this method reads the entire stream into memory, it negates the benefits of streams. It's intended for interoperability and convenience, not as the primary way to consume streams.

    @returns

    a promise containing an array with the contents of the stream.
  + [uncork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM/uncork)(): void;

    The `writable.uncork()` method flushes all data buffered since cork was called.

    When using `writable.cork()` and `writable.uncork()` to manage the buffering of writes to a stream, defer calls to `writable.uncork()` using `process.nextTick()`. Doing so allows batching of all `writable.write()` calls that occur within a given Node.js event loop phase.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => stream.uncork());
    ```

    If the `writable.cork()` method is called multiple times on a stream, the same number of calls to `writable.uncork()` must be called to flush the buffered data.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => {
      stream.uncork();
      // The data will not be flushed until uncork() is called a second time.
      stream.uncork();
    });
    ```

    See also: `writable.cork()`.
  + [unpipe](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM/unpipe)(

    destination?: WritableStream

    ): this;

    The `readable.unpipe()` method detaches a `Writable` stream previously attached using the pipe method.

    If the `destination` is not specified, then *all* pipes are detached.

    If the `destination` is specified, but no pipe is set up for it, then the method does nothing.

    ```
    import fs from 'node:fs';
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
    const writable = fs.createWriteStream('file.txt');
    // All the data from readable goes into 'file.txt',
    // but only for the first second.
    readable.pipe(writable);
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Stop writing to file.txt.');
      readable.unpipe(writable);
      console.log('Manually close the file stream.');
      writable.end();
    }, 1000);
    ```

    @param destination

    Optional specific stream to unpipe
  + [unshift](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM/unshift)(

    chunk: any,

    encoding?: BufferEncoding

    ): void;

    Passing `chunk` as `null` signals the end of the stream (EOF) and behaves the same as `readable.push(null)`, after which no more data can be written. The EOF signal is put at the end of the buffer and any buffered data will still be flushed.

    The `readable.unshift()` method pushes a chunk of data back into the internal buffer. This is useful in certain situations where a stream is being consumed by code that needs to "un-consume" some amount of data that it has optimistically pulled out of the source, so that the data can be passed on to some other party.

    The `stream.unshift(chunk)` method cannot be called after the `'end'` event has been emitted or a runtime error will be thrown.

    Developers using `stream.unshift()` often should consider switching to use of a `Transform` stream instead. See the `API for stream implementers` section for more information.

    ```
    // Pull off a header delimited by \n\n.
    // Use unshift() if we get too much.
    // Call the callback with (error, header, stream).
    import { StringDecoder } from 'node:string_decoder';
    function parseHeader(stream, callback) {
      stream.on('error', callback);
      stream.on('readable', onReadable);
      const decoder = new StringDecoder('utf8');
      let header = '';
      function onReadable() {
        let chunk;
        while (null !== (chunk = stream.read())) {
          const str = decoder.write(chunk);
          if (str.includes('\n\n')) {
            // Found the header boundary.
            const split = str.split(/\n\n/);
            header += split.shift();
            const remaining = split.join('\n\n');
            const buf = Buffer.from(remaining, 'utf8');
            stream.removeListener('error', callback);
            // Remove the 'readable' listener before unshifting.
            stream.removeListener('readable', onReadable);
            if (buf.length)
              stream.unshift(buf);
            // Now the body of the message can be read from the stream.
            callback(null, header, stream);
            return;
          }
          // Still reading the header.
          header += str;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Unlike push, `stream.unshift(chunk)` will not end the reading process by resetting the internal reading state of the stream. This can cause unexpected results if `readable.unshift()` is called during a read (i.e. from within a \_read implementation on a custom stream). Following the call to `readable.unshift()` with an immediate push will reset the reading state appropriately, however it is best to simply avoid calling `readable.unshift()` while in the process of performing a read.

    @param chunk

    Chunk of data to unshift onto the read queue. For streams not operating in object mode, `chunk` must be a {string}, {Buffer}, {TypedArray}, {DataView} or `null`. For object mode streams, `chunk` may be any JavaScript value.

    @param encoding

    Encoding of string chunks. Must be a valid `Buffer` encoding, such as `'utf8'` or `'ascii'`.

  + [wrap](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM/wrap)(

    stream: ReadableStream

    ): this;

    Prior to Node.js 0.10, streams did not implement the entire `node:stream` module API as it is currently defined. (See `Compatibility` for more information.)

    When using an older Node.js library that emits `'data'` events and has a pause method that is advisory only, the `readable.wrap()` method can be used to create a `Readable` stream that uses the old stream as its data source.

    It will rarely be necessary to use `readable.wrap()` but the method has been provided as a convenience for interacting with older Node.js applications and libraries.

    ```
    import { OldReader } from './old-api-module.js';
    import { Readable } from 'node:stream';
    const oreader = new OldReader();
    const myReader = new Readable().wrap(oreader);

    myReader.on('readable', () => {
      myReader.read(); // etc.
    });
    ```

    @param stream

    An "old style" readable stream
  + [write](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherCCM/write)(

    chunk: any,

    callback?: (error: undefined | null | [Error](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Error)) => void

    ): boolean;

    The `writable.write()` method writes some data to the stream, and calls the supplied `callback` once the data has been fully handled. If an error occurs, the `callback` will be called with the error as its first argument. The `callback` is called asynchronously and before `'error'` is emitted.

    The return value is `true` if the internal buffer is less than the `highWaterMark` configured when the stream was created after admitting `chunk`. If `false` is returned, further attempts to write data to the stream should stop until the `'drain'` event is emitted.

    While a stream is not draining, calls to `write()` will buffer `chunk`, and return false. Once all currently buffered chunks are drained (accepted for delivery by the operating system), the `'drain'` event will be emitted. Once `write()` returns false, do not write more chunks until the `'drain'` event is emitted. While calling `write()` on a stream that is not draining is allowed, Node.js will buffer all written chunks until maximum memory usage occurs, at which point it will abort unconditionally. Even before it aborts, high memory usage will cause poor garbage collector performance and high RSS (which is not typically released back to the system, even after the memory is no longer required). Since TCP sockets may never drain if the remote peer does not read the data, writing a socket that is not draining may lead to a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

    Writing data while the stream is not draining is particularly problematic for a `Transform`, because the `Transform` streams are paused by default until they are piped or a `'data'` or `'readable'` event handler is added.

    If the data to be written can be generated or fetched on demand, it is recommended to encapsulate the logic into a `Readable` and use pipe. However, if calling `write()` is preferred, it is possible to respect backpressure and avoid memory issues using the `'drain'` event:

    ```
    function write(data, cb) {
      if (!stream.write(data)) {
        stream.once('drain', cb);
      } else {
        process.nextTick(cb);
      }
    }

    // Wait for cb to be called before doing any other write.
    write('hello', () => {
      console.log('Write completed, do more writes now.');
    });
    ```

    A `Writable` stream in object mode will always ignore the `encoding` argument.

    Optional data to write. For streams not operating in object mode, `chunk` must be a {string}, {Buffer}, {TypedArray} or {DataView}. For object mode streams, `chunk` may be any JavaScript value other than `null`.

    Callback for when this chunk of data is flushed.

    @returns

    `false` if the stream wishes for the calling code to wait for the `'drain'` event to be emitted before continuing to write additional data; otherwise `true`.

* ### interface [DecipherChaCha20Poly1305](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherChaCha20Poly1305)

  Instances of the `Decipheriv` class are used to decrypt data. The class can be used in one of two ways:

  + As a `stream` that is both readable and writable, where plain encrypted data is written to produce unencrypted data on the readable side, or
  + Using the `decipher.update()` and `decipher.final()` methods to produce the unencrypted data.

  The createDecipheriv method is used to create `Decipheriv` instances. `Decipheriv` objects are not to be created directly using the `new` keyword.

  Example: Using `Decipheriv` objects as streams:

  ```
  import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';
  const {
    scryptSync,
    createDecipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';
  // Key length is dependent on the algorithm. In this case for aes192, it is
  // 24 bytes (192 bits).
  // Use the async `crypto.scrypt()` instead.
  const key = scryptSync(password, 'salt', 24);
  // The IV is usually passed along with the ciphertext.
  const iv = Buffer.alloc(16, 0); // Initialization vector.

  const decipher = createDecipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

  let decrypted = '';
  decipher.on('readable', () => {
    let chunk;
    while (null !== (chunk = decipher.read())) {
      decrypted += chunk.toString('utf8');
    }
  });
  decipher.on('end', () => {
    console.log(decrypted);
    // Prints: some clear text data
  });

  // Encrypted with same algorithm, key and iv.
  const encrypted =
    'e5f79c5915c02171eec6b212d5520d44480993d7d622a7c4c2da32f6efda0ffa';
  decipher.write(encrypted, 'hex');
  decipher.end();
  ```

  Example: Using `Decipheriv` and piped streams:

  ```
  import {
    createReadStream,
    createWriteStream,
  } from 'node:fs';
  import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';
  const {
    scryptSync,
    createDecipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';
  // Use the async `crypto.scrypt()` instead.
  const key = scryptSync(password, 'salt', 24);
  // The IV is usually passed along with the ciphertext.
  const iv = Buffer.alloc(16, 0); // Initialization vector.

  const decipher = createDecipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

  const input = createReadStream('test.enc');
  const output = createWriteStream('test.js');

  input.pipe(decipher).pipe(output);
  ```

  Example: Using the `decipher.update()` and `decipher.final()` methods:

  ```
  import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';
  const {
    scryptSync,
    createDecipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';
  // Use the async `crypto.scrypt()` instead.
  const key = scryptSync(password, 'salt', 24);
  // The IV is usually passed along with the ciphertext.
  const iv = Buffer.alloc(16, 0); // Initialization vector.

  const decipher = createDecipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

  // Encrypted using same algorithm, key and iv.
  const encrypted =
    'e5f79c5915c02171eec6b212d5520d44480993d7d622a7c4c2da32f6efda0ffa';
  let decrypted = decipher.update(encrypted, 'hex', 'utf8');
  decrypted += decipher.final('utf8');
  console.log(decrypted);
  // Prints: some clear text data
  ```

    This method returns a new stream with chunks of the underlying stream paired with a counter in the form `[index, chunk]`. The first index value is `0` and it increases by 1 for each chunk produced.

    @returns

    a stream of indexed pairs.

  + [cork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherChaCha20Poly1305/cork)(): void;

    The `writable.cork()` method forces all written data to be buffered in memory. The buffered data will be flushed when either the uncork or end methods are called.

    The primary intent of `writable.cork()` is to accommodate a situation in which several small chunks are written to the stream in rapid succession. Instead of immediately forwarding them to the underlying destination, `writable.cork()` buffers all the chunks until `writable.uncork()` is called, which will pass them all to `writable._writev()`, if present. This prevents a head-of-line blocking situation where data is being buffered while waiting for the first small chunk to be processed. However, use of `writable.cork()` without implementing `writable._writev()` may have an adverse effect on throughput.

    See also: `writable.uncork()`, `writable._writev()`.
  + [destroy](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherChaCha20Poly1305/destroy)(

    Destroy the stream. Optionally emit an `'error'` event, and emit a `'close'` event (unless `emitClose` is set to `false`). After this call, the readable stream will release any internal resources and subsequent calls to `push()` will be ignored.

    Once `destroy()` has been called any further calls will be a no-op and no further errors except from `_destroy()` may be emitted as `'error'`.

    Implementors should not override this method, but instead implement `readable._destroy()`.

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<boolean>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.every` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream to check if all awaited return values are truthy value for *fn*. Once an *fn* call on a chunk `await`ed return value is falsy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with `false`. If all of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a truthy value, the promise is fulfilled with `true`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise evaluating to `true` if *fn* returned a truthy value for every one of the chunks.

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.find` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream to find a chunk with a truthy value for *fn*. Once an *fn* call's awaited return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with value for which *fn* returned a truthy value. If all of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a falsy value, the promise is fulfilled with `undefined`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method returns a new stream by applying the given callback to each chunk of the stream and then flattening the result.

    It is possible to return a stream or another iterable or async iterable from *fn* and the result streams will be merged (flattened) into the returned stream.

    @param fn

    a function to map over every chunk in the stream. May be async. May be a stream or generator.

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<void>;

    This method allows iterating a stream. For each chunk in the stream the *fn* function will be called. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed.

    This method is different from `for await...of` loops in that it can optionally process chunks concurrently. In addition, a `forEach` iteration can only be stopped by having passed a `signal` option and aborting the related AbortController while `for await...of` can be stopped with `break` or `return`. In either case the stream will be destroyed.

    This method is different from listening to the `'data'` event in that it uses the `readable` event in the underlying machinary and can limit the number of concurrent *fn* calls.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise for when the stream has finished.
  + [getMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherChaCha20Poly1305/getMaxListeners)(): number;

  + [isPaused](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherChaCha20Poly1305/isPaused)(): boolean;

    The `readable.isPaused()` method returns the current operating state of the `Readable`. This is used primarily by the mechanism that underlies the `readable.pipe()` method. In most typical cases, there will be no reason to use this method directly.

    ```
    const readable = new stream.Readable();

    readable.isPaused(); // === false
    readable.pause();
    readable.isPaused(); // === true
    readable.resume();
    readable.isPaused(); // === false
    ```
  + [iterator](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherChaCha20Poly1305/iterator)(

    options?: { destroyOnReturn: boolean }

    ): AsyncIterator<any>;

    The iterator created by this method gives users the option to cancel the destruction of the stream if the `for await...of` loop is exited by `return`, `break`, or `throw`, or if the iterator should destroy the stream if the stream emitted an error during iteration.
  + [listenerCount](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherChaCha20Poly1305/listenerCount)<K>(

    eventName: string | symbol,

    Returns the number of listeners listening for the event named `eventName`. If `listener` is provided, it will return how many times the listener is found in the list of the listeners of the event.

    @param eventName

    The name of the event being listened for

    @param listener

    The event handler function
  + [listeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherChaCha20Poly1305/listeners)<K>(

    Returns a copy of the array of listeners for the event named `eventName`.

    ```
    server.on('connection', (stream) => {

    });
    console.log(util.inspect(server.listeners('connection')));

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method allows mapping over the stream. The *fn* function will be called for every chunk in the stream. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed before being passed to the result stream.

    @param fn

    a function to map over every chunk in the stream. Async or not.

    Alias for `emitter.removeListener()`.
  + [on](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherChaCha20Poly1305/on)(

    event: 'close',

    listener: () => void

    ): this;

    Adds the `listener` function to the end of the listeners array for the event named `eventName`. No checks are made to see if the `listener` has already been added. Multiple calls passing the same combination of `eventName` and `listener` will result in the `listener` being added, and called, multiple times.

    ```
    server.on('connection', (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    });
    ```

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

    By default, event listeners are invoked in the order they are added. The `emitter.prependListener()` method can be used as an alternative to add the event listener to the beginning of the listeners array.

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const myEE = new EventEmitter();
    myEE.on('foo', () => console.log('a'));
    myEE.prependListener('foo', () => console.log('b'));

    ```
  + [read](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherChaCha20Poly1305/read)(

    size?: number

    ): any;

    The `readable.read()` method reads data out of the internal buffer and returns it. If no data is available to be read, `null` is returned. By default, the data is returned as a `Buffer` object unless an encoding has been specified using the `readable.setEncoding()` method or the stream is operating in object mode.

    The optional `size` argument specifies a specific number of bytes to read. If `size` bytes are not available to be read, `null` will be returned *unless* the stream has ended, in which case all of the data remaining in the internal buffer will be returned.

    If the `size` argument is not specified, all of the data contained in the internal buffer will be returned.

    The `size` argument must be less than or equal to 1 GiB.

    The `readable.read()` method should only be called on `Readable` streams operating in paused mode. In flowing mode, `readable.read()` is called automatically until the internal buffer is fully drained.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();

    // 'readable' may be triggered multiple times as data is buffered in
    readable.on('readable', () => {
      let chunk;
      console.log('Stream is readable (new data received in buffer)');
      // Use a loop to make sure we read all currently available data
      while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
        console.log(`Read ${chunk.length} bytes of data...`);
      }
    });

    // 'end' will be triggered once when there is no more data available
    readable.on('end', () => {
      console.log('Reached end of stream.');
    });
    ```

    Each call to `readable.read()` returns a chunk of data, or `null`. The chunks are not concatenated. A `while` loop is necessary to consume all data currently in the buffer. When reading a large file `.read()` may return `null`, having consumed all buffered content so far, but there is still more data to come not yet buffered. In this case a new `'readable'` event will be emitted when there is more data in the buffer. Finally the `'end'` event will be emitted when there is no more data to come.

    Therefore to read a file's whole contents from a `readable`, it is necessary to collect chunks across multiple `'readable'` events:

    ```
    const chunks = [];

    readable.on('readable', () => {
      let chunk;
      while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
        chunks.push(chunk);
      }
    });

    readable.on('end', () => {
      const content = chunks.join('');
    });
    ```

    A `Readable` stream in object mode will always return a single item from a call to `readable.read(size)`, regardless of the value of the `size` argument.

    If the `readable.read()` method returns a chunk of data, a `'data'` event will also be emitted.

    Calling read after the `'end'` event has been emitted will return `null`. No runtime error will be raised.

    @param size

    Optional argument to specify how much data to read.

    initial?: undefined,

    options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>

    ): Promise<T>;

    This method calls *fn* on each chunk of the stream in order, passing it the result from the calculation on the previous element. It returns a promise for the final value of the reduction.

    If no *initial* value is supplied the first chunk of the stream is used as the initial value. If the stream is empty, the promise is rejected with a `TypeError` with the `ERR_INVALID_ARGS` code property.

    The reducer function iterates the stream element-by-element which means that there is no *concurrency* parameter or parallelism. To perform a reduce concurrently, you can extract the async function to `readable.map` method.

    @param fn

    a reducer function to call over every chunk in the stream. Async or not.

    @param initial

    the initial value to use in the reduction.

  + [removeAllListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherChaCha20Poly1305/removeAllListeners)(

    eventName?: string | symbol

    ): this;

    Removes all listeners, or those of the specified `eventName`.

    It is bad practice to remove listeners added elsewhere in the code, particularly when the `EventEmitter` instance was created by some other component or module (e.g. sockets or file streams).

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [removeListener](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherChaCha20Poly1305/removeListener)(

    event: 'close',

    listener: () => void

    ): this;

    Removes the specified `listener` from the listener array for the event named `eventName`.

    ```
    const callback = (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    };
    server.on('connection', callback);
    // ...
    server.removeListener('connection', callback);
    ```

    `removeListener()` will remove, at most, one instance of a listener from the listener array. If any single listener has been added multiple times to the listener array for the specified `eventName`, then `removeListener()` must be called multiple times to remove each instance.

    Once an event is emitted, all listeners attached to it at the time of emitting are called in order. This implies that any `removeListener()` or `removeAllListeners()` calls *after* emitting and *before* the last listener finishes execution will not remove them from`emit()` in progress. Subsequent events behave as expected.

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}
    const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

    const callbackA = () => {
      console.log('A');
      myEmitter.removeListener('event', callbackB);
    };

    const callbackB = () => {
      console.log('B');
    };

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackA);

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackB);

    // callbackA removes listener callbackB but it will still be called.
    // Internal listener array at time of emit [callbackA, callbackB]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    //   B

    // callbackB is now removed.
    // Internal listener array [callbackA]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    ```

    Because listeners are managed using an internal array, calling this will change the position indices of any listener registered *after* the listener being removed. This will not impact the order in which listeners are called, but it means that any copies of the listener array as returned by the `emitter.listeners()` method will need to be recreated.

    When a single function has been added as a handler multiple times for a single event (as in the example below), `removeListener()` will remove the most recently added instance. In the example the `once('ping')` listener is removed:

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const ee = new EventEmitter();

    function pong() {
      console.log('pong');
    }

    ee.on('ping', pong);
    ee.once('ping', pong);
    ee.removeListener('ping', pong);

    ee.emit('ping');
    ee.emit('ping');
    ```

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

Setting an encoding causes the stream data to be returned as strings of the specified encoding rather than as `Buffer` objects. For instance, calling `readable.setEncoding('utf8')` will cause the output data to be interpreted as UTF-8 data, and passed as strings. Calling `readable.setEncoding('hex')` will cause the data to be encoded in hexadecimal string format.

    The `Readable` stream will properly handle multi-byte characters delivered through the stream that would otherwise become improperly decoded if simply pulled from the stream as `Buffer` objects.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
    readable.setEncoding('utf8');
    readable.on('data', (chunk) => {
      assert.equal(typeof chunk, 'string');
      console.log('Got %d characters of string data:', chunk.length);
    });
    ```

    @param encoding

    The encoding to use.
  + [setMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherChaCha20Poly1305/setMaxListeners)(

    n: number

    ): this;

    By default `EventEmitter`s will print a warning if more than `10` listeners are added for a particular event. This is a useful default that helps finding memory leaks. The `emitter.setMaxListeners()` method allows the limit to be modified for this specific `EventEmitter` instance. The value can be set to `Infinity` (or `0`) to indicate an unlimited number of listeners.

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [some](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherChaCha20Poly1305/some)(

    fn: (data: any, options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>) => boolean | Promise<boolean>,

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<boolean>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.some` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream until the awaited return value is `true` (or any truthy value). Once an *fn* call on a chunk `await`ed return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with `true`. If none of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a truthy value, the promise is fulfilled with `false`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise evaluating to `true` if *fn* returned a truthy value for at least one of the chunks.
  + [take](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherChaCha20Poly1305/take)(

    options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method returns a new stream with the first *limit* chunks.

    @param limit

    the number of chunks to take from the readable.

    @returns

    a stream with *limit* chunks taken.
  + [toArray](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherChaCha20Poly1305/toArray)(

    options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>

    ): Promise<any[]>;

    This method allows easily obtaining the contents of a stream.

    As this method reads the entire stream into memory, it negates the benefits of streams. It's intended for interoperability and convenience, not as the primary way to consume streams.

    @returns

    a promise containing an array with the contents of the stream.
  + [uncork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherChaCha20Poly1305/uncork)(): void;

    The `writable.uncork()` method flushes all data buffered since cork was called.

    When using `writable.cork()` and `writable.uncork()` to manage the buffering of writes to a stream, defer calls to `writable.uncork()` using `process.nextTick()`. Doing so allows batching of all `writable.write()` calls that occur within a given Node.js event loop phase.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => stream.uncork());
    ```

    If the `writable.cork()` method is called multiple times on a stream, the same number of calls to `writable.uncork()` must be called to flush the buffered data.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => {
      stream.uncork();
      // The data will not be flushed until uncork() is called a second time.
      stream.uncork();
    });
    ```

    See also: `writable.cork()`.
  + [unpipe](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherChaCha20Poly1305/unpipe)(

    destination?: WritableStream

    ): this;

    The `readable.unpipe()` method detaches a `Writable` stream previously attached using the pipe method.

    If the `destination` is not specified, then *all* pipes are detached.

    If the `destination` is specified, but no pipe is set up for it, then the method does nothing.

    ```
    import fs from 'node:fs';
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
    const writable = fs.createWriteStream('file.txt');
    // All the data from readable goes into 'file.txt',
    // but only for the first second.
    readable.pipe(writable);
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Stop writing to file.txt.');
      readable.unpipe(writable);
      console.log('Manually close the file stream.');
      writable.end();
    }, 1000);
    ```

    @param destination

    Optional specific stream to unpipe
  + [unshift](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherChaCha20Poly1305/unshift)(

    chunk: any,

    encoding?: BufferEncoding

    ): void;

    Passing `chunk` as `null` signals the end of the stream (EOF) and behaves the same as `readable.push(null)`, after which no more data can be written. The EOF signal is put at the end of the buffer and any buffered data will still be flushed.

    The `readable.unshift()` method pushes a chunk of data back into the internal buffer. This is useful in certain situations where a stream is being consumed by code that needs to "un-consume" some amount of data that it has optimistically pulled out of the source, so that the data can be passed on to some other party.

    The `stream.unshift(chunk)` method cannot be called after the `'end'` event has been emitted or a runtime error will be thrown.

    Developers using `stream.unshift()` often should consider switching to use of a `Transform` stream instead. See the `API for stream implementers` section for more information.

    ```
    // Pull off a header delimited by \n\n.
    // Use unshift() if we get too much.
    // Call the callback with (error, header, stream).
    import { StringDecoder } from 'node:string_decoder';
    function parseHeader(stream, callback) {
      stream.on('error', callback);
      stream.on('readable', onReadable);
      const decoder = new StringDecoder('utf8');
      let header = '';
      function onReadable() {
        let chunk;
        while (null !== (chunk = stream.read())) {
          const str = decoder.write(chunk);
          if (str.includes('\n\n')) {
            // Found the header boundary.
            const split = str.split(/\n\n/);
            header += split.shift();
            const remaining = split.join('\n\n');
            const buf = Buffer.from(remaining, 'utf8');
            stream.removeListener('error', callback);
            // Remove the 'readable' listener before unshifting.
            stream.removeListener('readable', onReadable);
            if (buf.length)
              stream.unshift(buf);
            // Now the body of the message can be read from the stream.
            callback(null, header, stream);
            return;
          }
          // Still reading the header.
          header += str;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Unlike push, `stream.unshift(chunk)` will not end the reading process by resetting the internal reading state of the stream. This can cause unexpected results if `readable.unshift()` is called during a read (i.e. from within a \_read implementation on a custom stream). Following the call to `readable.unshift()` with an immediate push will reset the reading state appropriately, however it is best to simply avoid calling `readable.unshift()` while in the process of performing a read.

    @param chunk

    Chunk of data to unshift onto the read queue. For streams not operating in object mode, `chunk` must be a {string}, {Buffer}, {TypedArray}, {DataView} or `null`. For object mode streams, `chunk` may be any JavaScript value.

    @param encoding

    Encoding of string chunks. Must be a valid `Buffer` encoding, such as `'utf8'` or `'ascii'`.

  + [wrap](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherChaCha20Poly1305/wrap)(

    stream: ReadableStream

    ): this;

    Prior to Node.js 0.10, streams did not implement the entire `node:stream` module API as it is currently defined. (See `Compatibility` for more information.)

    When using an older Node.js library that emits `'data'` events and has a pause method that is advisory only, the `readable.wrap()` method can be used to create a `Readable` stream that uses the old stream as its data source.

    It will rarely be necessary to use `readable.wrap()` but the method has been provided as a convenience for interacting with older Node.js applications and libraries.

    ```
    import { OldReader } from './old-api-module.js';
    import { Readable } from 'node:stream';
    const oreader = new OldReader();
    const myReader = new Readable().wrap(oreader);

      myReader.read(); // etc.
    });

    chunk: any,

    callback?: (error: undefined | null | [Error](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Error)) => void

    ): boolean;

    The `writable.write()` method writes some data to the stream, and calls the supplied `callback` once the data has been fully handled. If an error occurs, the `callback` will be called with the error as its first argument. The `callback` is called asynchronously and before `'error'` is emitted.

    The return value is `true` if the internal buffer is less than the `highWaterMark` configured when the stream was created after admitting `chunk`. If `false` is returned, further attempts to write data to the stream should stop until the `'drain'` event is emitted.

    While a stream is not draining, calls to `write()` will buffer `chunk`, and return false. Once all currently buffered chunks are drained (accepted for delivery by the operating system), the `'drain'` event will be emitted. Once `write()` returns false, do not write more chunks until the `'drain'` event is emitted. While calling `write()` on a stream that is not draining is allowed, Node.js will buffer all written chunks until maximum memory usage occurs, at which point it will abort unconditionally. Even before it aborts, high memory usage will cause poor garbage collector performance and high RSS (which is not typically released back to the system, even after the memory is no longer required). Since TCP sockets may never drain if the remote peer does not read the data, writing a socket that is not draining may lead to a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

    Writing data while the stream is not draining is particularly problematic for a `Transform`, because the `Transform` streams are paused by default until they are piped or a `'data'` or `'readable'` event handler is added.

    If the data to be written can be generated or fetched on demand, it is recommended to encapsulate the logic into a `Readable` and use pipe. However, if calling `write()` is preferred, it is possible to respect backpressure and avoid memory issues using the `'drain'` event:

    ```
    function write(data, cb) {
      if (!stream.write(data)) {
        stream.once('drain', cb);
      } else {
        process.nextTick(cb);
      }
    }

    // Wait for cb to be called before doing any other write.

      console.log('Write completed, do more writes now.');

* ### interface [DecipherGCM](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM)

  Instances of the `Decipheriv` class are used to decrypt data. The class can be used in one of two ways:

  + As a `stream` that is both readable and writable, where plain encrypted data is written to produce unencrypted data on the readable side, or
  + Using the `decipher.update()` and `decipher.final()` methods to produce the unencrypted data.

  The createDecipheriv method is used to create `Decipheriv` instances. `Decipheriv` objects are not to be created directly using the `new` keyword.

  Example: Using `Decipheriv` objects as streams:

  ```
  import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';
  const {
    scryptSync,
    createDecipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';
  // Key length is dependent on the algorithm. In this case for aes192, it is
  // 24 bytes (192 bits).
  // Use the async `crypto.scrypt()` instead.
  const key = scryptSync(password, 'salt', 24);
  // The IV is usually passed along with the ciphertext.
  const iv = Buffer.alloc(16, 0); // Initialization vector.

  const decipher = createDecipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

  let decrypted = '';
  decipher.on('readable', () => {
    let chunk;
    while (null !== (chunk = decipher.read())) {
      decrypted += chunk.toString('utf8');
    }
  });
  decipher.on('end', () => {
    console.log(decrypted);
    // Prints: some clear text data
  });

  // Encrypted with same algorithm, key and iv.
  const encrypted =
    'e5f79c5915c02171eec6b212d5520d44480993d7d622a7c4c2da32f6efda0ffa';
  decipher.write(encrypted, 'hex');
  decipher.end();
  ```

  Example: Using `Decipheriv` and piped streams:

  ```
  import {
    createReadStream,
    createWriteStream,
  } from 'node:fs';
  import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';
  const {
    scryptSync,
    createDecipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';
  // Use the async `crypto.scrypt()` instead.
  const key = scryptSync(password, 'salt', 24);
  // The IV is usually passed along with the ciphertext.
  const iv = Buffer.alloc(16, 0); // Initialization vector.

  const decipher = createDecipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

  const input = createReadStream('test.enc');
  const output = createWriteStream('test.js');

  input.pipe(decipher).pipe(output);
  ```

  Example: Using the `decipher.update()` and `decipher.final()` methods:

  ```
  import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';
  const {
    scryptSync,
    createDecipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';
  // Use the async `crypto.scrypt()` instead.
  const key = scryptSync(password, 'salt', 24);
  // The IV is usually passed along with the ciphertext.
  const iv = Buffer.alloc(16, 0); // Initialization vector.

  const decipher = createDecipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

  // Encrypted using same algorithm, key and iv.
  const encrypted =
    'e5f79c5915c02171eec6b212d5520d44480993d7d622a7c4c2da32f6efda0ffa';
  let decrypted = decipher.update(encrypted, 'hex', 'utf8');
  decrypted += decipher.final('utf8');
  console.log(decrypted);
  // Prints: some clear text data
  ```

    This method returns a new stream with chunks of the underlying stream paired with a counter in the form `[index, chunk]`. The first index value is `0` and it increases by 1 for each chunk produced.

  + [cork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/cork)(): void;

    The `writable.cork()` method forces all written data to be buffered in memory. The buffered data will be flushed when either the uncork or end methods are called.

    The primary intent of `writable.cork()` is to accommodate a situation in which several small chunks are written to the stream in rapid succession. Instead of immediately forwarding them to the underlying destination, `writable.cork()` buffers all the chunks until `writable.uncork()` is called, which will pass them all to `writable._writev()`, if present. This prevents a head-of-line blocking situation where data is being buffered while waiting for the first small chunk to be processed. However, use of `writable.cork()` without implementing `writable._writev()` may have an adverse effect on throughput.

    See also: `writable.uncork()`, `writable._writev()`.

    Destroy the stream. Optionally emit an `'error'` event, and emit a `'close'` event (unless `emitClose` is set to `false`). After this call, the readable stream will release any internal resources and subsequent calls to `push()` will be ignored.

    Once `destroy()` has been called any further calls will be a no-op and no further errors except from `_destroy()` may be emitted as `'error'`.

    Implementors should not override this method, but instead implement `readable._destroy()`.

    This method returns a new stream by applying the given callback to each chunk of the stream and then flattening the result.

    It is possible to return a stream or another iterable or async iterable from *fn* and the result streams will be merged (flattened) into the returned stream.

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<void>;

    This method allows iterating a stream. For each chunk in the stream the *fn* function will be called. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed.

    This method is different from `for await...of` loops in that it can optionally process chunks concurrently. In addition, a `forEach` iteration can only be stopped by having passed a `signal` option and aborting the related AbortController while `for await...of` can be stopped with `break` or `return`. In either case the stream will be destroyed.

    This method is different from listening to the `'data'` event in that it uses the `readable` event in the underlying machinary and can limit the number of concurrent *fn* calls.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise for when the stream has finished.
  + [getMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/getMaxListeners)(): number;

    Returns the current max listener value for the `EventEmitter` which is either set by `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` or defaults to EventEmitter.defaultMaxListeners.
  + [isPaused](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/isPaused)(): boolean;

    The `readable.isPaused()` method returns the current operating state of the `Readable`. This is used primarily by the mechanism that underlies the `readable.pipe()` method. In most typical cases, there will be no reason to use this method directly.

    ```
    const readable = new stream.Readable();

    readable.isPaused(); // === false
    readable.pause();
    readable.isPaused(); // === true
    readable.resume();
    readable.isPaused(); // === false
    ```
  + [iterator](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/iterator)(

    options?: { destroyOnReturn: boolean }

    ): AsyncIterator<any>;

    The iterator created by this method gives users the option to cancel the destruction of the stream if the `for await...of` loop is exited by `return`, `break`, or `throw`, or if the iterator should destroy the stream if the stream emitted an error during iteration.
  + [listenerCount](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/listenerCount)<K>(

    eventName: string | symbol,

    listener?: Function

    ): number;

    Returns the number of listeners listening for the event named `eventName`. If `listener` is provided, it will return how many times the listener is found in the list of the listeners of the event.

    @param eventName

    The name of the event being listened for

    @param listener

    The event handler function
  + [listeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/listeners)<K>(

    eventName: string | symbol

    ): Function[];

    Returns a copy of the array of listeners for the event named `eventName`.

    ```
    server.on('connection', (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    });
    console.log(util.inspect(server.listeners('connection')));
    // Prints: [ [Function] ]
    ```
  + [map](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/map)(

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method allows mapping over the stream. The *fn* function will be called for every chunk in the stream. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed before being passed to the result stream.

    @param fn

    a function to map over every chunk in the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a stream mapped with the function *fn*.
  + [off](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/off)<K>(

    eventName: string | symbol,

    listener: (...args: any[]) => void

    ): this;

    Alias for `emitter.removeListener()`.
  + [on](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/on)(

    event: 'close',

    listener: () => void

    ): this;

    Adds the `listener` function to the end of the listeners array for the event named `eventName`. No checks are made to see if the `listener` has already been added. Multiple calls passing the same combination of `eventName` and `listener` will result in the `listener` being added, and called, multiple times.

    ```
    server.on('connection', (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    });
    ```

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

    By default, event listeners are invoked in the order they are added. The `emitter.prependListener()` method can be used as an alternative to add the event listener to the beginning of the listeners array.

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const myEE = new EventEmitter();
    myEE.on('foo', () => console.log('a'));
    myEE.prependListener('foo', () => console.log('b'));
    myEE.emit('foo');
    // Prints:
    //   b
    //   a

    });
    ```

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

    By default, event listeners are invoked in the order they are added. The `emitter.prependOnceListener()` method can be used as an alternative to add the event listener to the beginning of the listeners array.

  + [pause](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/pause)(): this;

    The `readable.pause()` method will cause a stream in flowing mode to stop emitting `'data'` events, switching out of flowing mode. Any data that becomes available will remain in the internal buffer.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
    readable.on('data', (chunk) => {

    ```
  + [read](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/read)(

    size?: number

    ): any;

    The `readable.read()` method reads data out of the internal buffer and returns it. If no data is available to be read, `null` is returned. By default, the data is returned as a `Buffer` object unless an encoding has been specified using the `readable.setEncoding()` method or the stream is operating in object mode.

    The optional `size` argument specifies a specific number of bytes to read. If `size` bytes are not available to be read, `null` will be returned *unless* the stream has ended, in which case all of the data remaining in the internal buffer will be returned.

    If the `size` argument is not specified, all of the data contained in the internal buffer will be returned.

    The `size` argument must be less than or equal to 1 GiB.

    The `readable.read()` method should only be called on `Readable` streams operating in paused mode. In flowing mode, `readable.read()` is called automatically until the internal buffer is fully drained.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();

    // 'readable' may be triggered multiple times as data is buffered in
    readable.on('readable', () => {
      let chunk;
      console.log('Stream is readable (new data received in buffer)');
      // Use a loop to make sure we read all currently available data
      while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
        console.log(`Read ${chunk.length} bytes of data...`);
      }
    });

    // 'end' will be triggered once when there is no more data available
    readable.on('end', () => {
      console.log('Reached end of stream.');
    });
    ```

    Each call to `readable.read()` returns a chunk of data, or `null`. The chunks are not concatenated. A `while` loop is necessary to consume all data currently in the buffer. When reading a large file `.read()` may return `null`, having consumed all buffered content so far, but there is still more data to come not yet buffered. In this case a new `'readable'` event will be emitted when there is more data in the buffer. Finally the `'end'` event will be emitted when there is no more data to come.

    Therefore to read a file's whole contents from a `readable`, it is necessary to collect chunks across multiple `'readable'` events:

    ```
    const chunks = [];

    readable.on('readable', () => {
      let chunk;
      while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
        chunks.push(chunk);
      }
    });

    readable.on('end', () => {
      const content = chunks.join('');
    });
    ```

    A `Readable` stream in object mode will always return a single item from a call to `readable.read(size)`, regardless of the value of the `size` argument.

    If the `readable.read()` method returns a chunk of data, a `'data'` event will also be emitted.

    Calling read after the `'end'` event has been emitted will return `null`. No runtime error will be raised.

    @param size

    Optional argument to specify how much data to read.
  + [reduce](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/reduce)<T = any>(

    initial?: undefined,

    options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>

    ): Promise<T>;

    This method calls *fn* on each chunk of the stream in order, passing it the result from the calculation on the previous element. It returns a promise for the final value of the reduction.

    If no *initial* value is supplied the first chunk of the stream is used as the initial value. If the stream is empty, the promise is rejected with a `TypeError` with the `ERR_INVALID_ARGS` code property.

    The reducer function iterates the stream element-by-element which means that there is no *concurrency* parameter or parallelism. To perform a reduce concurrently, you can extract the async function to `readable.map` method.

    @param fn

    a reducer function to call over every chunk in the stream. Async or not.

    @param initial

    the initial value to use in the reduction.

  + [removeAllListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/removeAllListeners)(

    eventName?: string | symbol

    ): this;

    Removes all listeners, or those of the specified `eventName`.

    It is bad practice to remove listeners added elsewhere in the code, particularly when the `EventEmitter` instance was created by some other component or module (e.g. sockets or file streams).

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [removeListener](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/removeListener)(

    event: 'close',

    listener: () => void

    ): this;

    Removes the specified `listener` from the listener array for the event named `eventName`.

    ```
    const callback = (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    };
    server.on('connection', callback);
    // ...
    server.removeListener('connection', callback);
    ```

    `removeListener()` will remove, at most, one instance of a listener from the listener array. If any single listener has been added multiple times to the listener array for the specified `eventName`, then `removeListener()` must be called multiple times to remove each instance.

    Once an event is emitted, all listeners attached to it at the time of emitting are called in order. This implies that any `removeListener()` or `removeAllListeners()` calls *after* emitting and *before* the last listener finishes execution will not remove them from`emit()` in progress. Subsequent events behave as expected.

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}
    const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

    const callbackA = () => {
      console.log('A');
      myEmitter.removeListener('event', callbackB);
    };

    const callbackB = () => {
      console.log('B');
    };

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackA);

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackB);

    // callbackA removes listener callbackB but it will still be called.
    // Internal listener array at time of emit [callbackA, callbackB]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    //   B

    // callbackB is now removed.
    // Internal listener array [callbackA]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    ```

    Because listeners are managed using an internal array, calling this will change the position indices of any listener registered *after* the listener being removed. This will not impact the order in which listeners are called, but it means that any copies of the listener array as returned by the `emitter.listeners()` method will need to be recreated.

    When a single function has been added as a handler multiple times for a single event (as in the example below), `removeListener()` will remove the most recently added instance. In the example the `once('ping')` listener is removed:

  + [resume](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/resume)(): this;

    The `readable.resume()` method causes an explicitly paused `Readable` stream to resume emitting `'data'` events, switching the stream into flowing mode.

    The `readable.resume()` method can be used to fully consume the data from a stream without actually processing any of that data:

    ```
    getReadableStreamSomehow()
      .resume()
      .on('end', () => {
        console.log('Reached the end, but did not read anything.');
      });
    ```

    The `readable.resume()` method has no effect if there is a `'readable'` event listener.

  + [setAutoPadding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/setAutoPadding)(

    auto\_padding?: boolean

    ): this;

    When data has been encrypted without standard block padding, calling `decipher.setAutoPadding(false)` will disable automatic padding to prevent `decipher.final()` from checking for and removing padding.

    Turning auto padding off will only work if the input data's length is a multiple of the ciphers block size.

    The `decipher.setAutoPadding()` method must be called before `decipher.final()`.

    @returns

    for method chaining.
  + [setDefaultEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/setDefaultEncoding)(

    encoding: BufferEncoding

    ): this;

    The `writable.setDefaultEncoding()` method sets the default `encoding` for a `Writable` stream.

    @param encoding

    The new default encoding
  + [setEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/setEncoding)(

    encoding: BufferEncoding

    ): this;

    The `readable.setEncoding()` method sets the character encoding for data read from the `Readable` stream.

    By default, no encoding is assigned and stream data will be returned as `Buffer` objects. Setting an encoding causes the stream data to be returned as strings of the specified encoding rather than as `Buffer` objects. For instance, calling `readable.setEncoding('utf8')` will cause the output data to be interpreted as UTF-8 data, and passed as strings. Calling `readable.setEncoding('hex')` will cause the data to be encoded in hexadecimal string format.

    The `Readable` stream will properly handle multi-byte characters delivered through the stream that would otherwise become improperly decoded if simply pulled from the stream as `Buffer` objects.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
    readable.setEncoding('utf8');
    readable.on('data', (chunk) => {
      assert.equal(typeof chunk, 'string');
      console.log('Got %d characters of string data:', chunk.length);
    });
    ```

    @param encoding

    The encoding to use.
  + [setMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/setMaxListeners)(

    n: number

    ): this;

    By default `EventEmitter`s will print a warning if more than `10` listeners are added for a particular event. This is a useful default that helps finding memory leaks. The `emitter.setMaxListeners()` method allows the limit to be modified for this specific `EventEmitter` instance. The value can be set to `Infinity` (or `0`) to indicate an unlimited number of listeners.

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [some](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/some)(

    fn: (data: any, options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>) => boolean | Promise<boolean>,

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<boolean>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.some` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream until the awaited return value is `true` (or any truthy value). Once an *fn* call on a chunk `await`ed return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with `true`. If none of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a truthy value, the promise is fulfilled with `false`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise evaluating to `true` if *fn* returned a truthy value for at least one of the chunks.
  + [take](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/take)(

    limit: number,

    options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method returns a new stream with the first *limit* chunks.

    @param limit

    the number of chunks to take from the readable.

    @returns

    a stream with *limit* chunks taken.
  + [toArray](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/toArray)(

    options?: Pick<[ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions), 'signal'>

    ): Promise<any[]>;

    This method allows easily obtaining the contents of a stream.

    As this method reads the entire stream into memory, it negates the benefits of streams. It's intended for interoperability and convenience, not as the primary way to consume streams.

    @returns

    a promise containing an array with the contents of the stream.
  + [uncork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/uncork)(): void;

    The `writable.uncork()` method flushes all data buffered since cork was called.

    When using `writable.cork()` and `writable.uncork()` to manage the buffering of writes to a stream, defer calls to `writable.uncork()` using `process.nextTick()`. Doing so allows batching of all `writable.write()` calls that occur within a given Node.js event loop phase.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => stream.uncork());
    ```

    If the `writable.cork()` method is called multiple times on a stream, the same number of calls to `writable.uncork()` must be called to flush the buffered data.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => {
      stream.uncork();
      // The data will not be flushed until uncork() is called a second time.
      stream.uncork();
    });
    ```

    See also: `writable.cork()`.
  + [unpipe](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/unpipe)(

    destination?: WritableStream

    ): this;

    The `readable.unpipe()` method detaches a `Writable` stream previously attached using the pipe method.

    If the `destination` is not specified, then *all* pipes are detached.

    If the `destination` is specified, but no pipe is set up for it, then the method does nothing.

    ```
    import fs from 'node:fs';
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
    const writable = fs.createWriteStream('file.txt');
    // All the data from readable goes into 'file.txt',
    // but only for the first second.
    readable.pipe(writable);
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Stop writing to file.txt.');
      readable.unpipe(writable);
      console.log('Manually close the file stream.');
      writable.end();
    }, 1000);
    ```

    @param destination

    Optional specific stream to unpipe
  + [unshift](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherGCM/unshift)(

    chunk: any,

    encoding?: BufferEncoding

    ): void;

    Passing `chunk` as `null` signals the end of the stream (EOF) and behaves the same as `readable.push(null)`, after which no more data can be written. The EOF signal is put at the end of the buffer and any buffered data will still be flushed.

    The `readable.unshift()` method pushes a chunk of data back into the internal buffer. This is useful in certain situations where a stream is being consumed by code that needs to "un-consume" some amount of data that it has optimistically pulled out of the source, so that the data can be passed on to some other party.

    The `stream.unshift(chunk)` method cannot be called after the `'end'` event has been emitted or a runtime error will be thrown.

    Developers using `stream.unshift()` often should consider switching to use of a `Transform` stream instead. See the `API for stream implementers` section for more information.

    ```
    // Pull off a header delimited by \n\n.
    // Use unshift() if we get too much.
    // Call the callback with (error, header, stream).
    import { StringDecoder } from 'node:string_decoder';
    function parseHeader(stream, callback) {
      stream.on('error', callback);
      stream.on('readable', onReadable);
      const decoder = new StringDecoder('utf8');
      let header = '';
      function onReadable() {
        let chunk;
        while (null !== (chunk = stream.read())) {
          const str = decoder.write(chunk);
          if (str.includes('\n\n')) {
            // Found the header boundary.
            const split = str.split(/\n\n/);
            header += split.shift();
            const remaining = split.join('\n\n');
            const buf = Buffer.from(remaining, 'utf8');
            stream.removeListener('error', callback);
            // Remove the 'readable' listener before unshifting.
            stream.removeListener('readable', onReadable);
            if (buf.length)
              stream.unshift(buf);
            // Now the body of the message can be read from the stream.
            callback(null, header, stream);
            return;
          }
          // Still reading the header.
          header += str;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Unlike push, `stream.unshift(chunk)` will not end the reading process by resetting the internal reading state of the stream. This can cause unexpected results if `readable.unshift()` is called during a read (i.e. from within a \_read implementation on a custom stream). Following the call to `readable.unshift()` with an immediate push will reset the reading state appropriately, however it is best to simply avoid calling `readable.unshift()` while in the process of performing a read.

    @param chunk

    Chunk of data to unshift onto the read queue. For streams not operating in object mode, `chunk` must be a {string}, {Buffer}, {TypedArray}, {DataView} or `null`. For object mode streams, `chunk` may be any JavaScript value.

    Encoding of string chunks. Must be a valid `Buffer` encoding, such as `'utf8'` or `'ascii'`.

    stream: ReadableStream

    ): this;

    Prior to Node.js 0.10, streams did not implement the entire `node:stream` module API as it is currently defined. (See `Compatibility` for more information.)

    When using an older Node.js library that emits `'data'` events and has a pause method that is advisory only, the `readable.wrap()` method can be used to create a `Readable` stream that uses the old stream as its data source.

    It will rarely be necessary to use `readable.wrap()` but the method has been provided as a convenience for interacting with older Node.js applications and libraries.

    ```
    import { OldReader } from './old-api-module.js';
    import { Readable } from 'node:stream';
    const oreader = new OldReader();
    const myReader = new Readable().wrap(oreader);

      myReader.read(); // etc.

    chunk: any,

    callback?: (error: undefined | null | [Error](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Error)) => void

    ): boolean;

    The `writable.write()` method writes some data to the stream, and calls the supplied `callback` once the data has been fully handled. If an error occurs, the `callback` will be called with the error as its first argument. The `callback` is called asynchronously and before `'error'` is emitted.

    The return value is `true` if the internal buffer is less than the `highWaterMark` configured when the stream was created after admitting `chunk`. If `false` is returned, further attempts to write data to the stream should stop until the `'drain'` event is emitted.

    While a stream is not draining, calls to `write()` will buffer `chunk`, and return false. Once all currently buffered chunks are drained (accepted for delivery by the operating system), the `'drain'` event will be emitted. Once `write()` returns false, do not write more chunks until the `'drain'` event is emitted. While calling `write()` on a stream that is not draining is allowed, Node.js will buffer all written chunks until maximum memory usage occurs, at which point it will abort unconditionally. Even before it aborts, high memory usage will cause poor garbage collector performance and high RSS (which is not typically released back to the system, even after the memory is no longer required). Since TCP sockets may never drain if the remote peer does not read the data, writing a socket that is not draining may lead to a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

    Writing data while the stream is not draining is particularly problematic for a `Transform`, because the `Transform` streams are paused by default until they are piped or a `'data'` or `'readable'` event handler is added.

    If the data to be written can be generated or fetched on demand, it is recommended to encapsulate the logic into a `Readable` and use pipe. However, if calling `write()` is preferred, it is possible to respect backpressure and avoid memory issues using the `'drain'` event:

    ```
    function write(data, cb) {
      if (!stream.write(data)) {
        stream.once('drain', cb);
      } else {
        process.nextTick(cb);
      }
    }

    // Wait for cb to be called before doing any other write.

* ### interface [DecipherOCB](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB)

  Instances of the `Decipheriv` class are used to decrypt data. The class can be used in one of two ways:

  + As a `stream` that is both readable and writable, where plain encrypted data is written to produce unencrypted data on the readable side, or
  + Using the `decipher.update()` and `decipher.final()` methods to produce the unencrypted data.

  The createDecipheriv method is used to create `Decipheriv` instances. `Decipheriv` objects are not to be created directly using the `new` keyword.

  Example: Using `Decipheriv` objects as streams:

  ```
  import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';
  const {
    scryptSync,
    createDecipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';
  // Key length is dependent on the algorithm. In this case for aes192, it is
  // 24 bytes (192 bits).
  // Use the async `crypto.scrypt()` instead.
  const key = scryptSync(password, 'salt', 24);
  // The IV is usually passed along with the ciphertext.
  const iv = Buffer.alloc(16, 0); // Initialization vector.

  const decipher = createDecipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

  let decrypted = '';
  decipher.on('readable', () => {
    let chunk;
    while (null !== (chunk = decipher.read())) {
      decrypted += chunk.toString('utf8');
    }
  });
  decipher.on('end', () => {
    console.log(decrypted);
    // Prints: some clear text data
  });

  // Encrypted with same algorithm, key and iv.
  const encrypted =
    'e5f79c5915c02171eec6b212d5520d44480993d7d622a7c4c2da32f6efda0ffa';
  decipher.write(encrypted, 'hex');
  decipher.end();
  ```

  Example: Using `Decipheriv` and piped streams:

  ```
  import {
    createReadStream,
    createWriteStream,
  } from 'node:fs';
  import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';
  const {
    scryptSync,
    createDecipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';
  // Use the async `crypto.scrypt()` instead.
  const key = scryptSync(password, 'salt', 24);
  // The IV is usually passed along with the ciphertext.

  Example: Using the `decipher.update()` and `decipher.final()` methods:

  ```
  import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';
  const {
    scryptSync,
    createDecipheriv,
  } = await import('node:crypto');

  const algorithm = 'aes-192-cbc';
  const password = 'Password used to generate key';
  // Use the async `crypto.scrypt()` instead.
  const key = scryptSync(password, 'salt', 24);
  // The IV is usually passed along with the ciphertext.
  const iv = Buffer.alloc(16, 0); // Initialization vector.

  const decipher = createDecipheriv(algorithm, key, iv);

  // Encrypted using same algorithm, key and iv.
  const encrypted =
    'e5f79c5915c02171eec6b212d5520d44480993d7d622a7c4c2da32f6efda0ffa';
  let decrypted = decipher.update(encrypted, 'hex', 'utf8');
  decrypted += decipher.final('utf8');
  console.log(decrypted);
  // Prints: some clear text data
  ```

  + [allowHalfOpen](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/allowHalfOpen): boolean

    If `false` then the stream will automatically end the writable side when the readable side ends. Set initially by the `allowHalfOpen` constructor option, which defaults to `true`.

    This can be changed manually to change the half-open behavior of an existing `Duplex` stream instance, but must be changed before the `'end'` event is emitted.
  + readonly [closed](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/closed): boolean

    Is `true` after `'close'` has been emitted.
  + [destroyed](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/destroyed): boolean

    Getter for the property `objectMode` of a given `Readable` stream.
  + readonly [writable](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/writable): boolean

    Is `true` if it is safe to call `writable.write()`, which means the stream has not been destroyed, errored, or ended.
  + readonly [writableAborted](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/writableAborted): boolean

    Returns whether the stream was destroyed or errored before emitting `'finish'`.
  + readonly [writableCorked](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/writableCorked): number

    Number of times `writable.uncork()` needs to be called in order to fully uncork the stream.
  + readonly [writableEnded](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/writableEnded): boolean

    This method returns a new stream with chunks of the underlying stream paired with a counter in the form `[index, chunk]`. The first index value is `0` and it increases by 1 for each chunk produced.

  + [cork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/cork)(): void;

    The `writable.cork()` method forces all written data to be buffered in memory. The buffered data will be flushed when either the uncork or end methods are called.

    The primary intent of `writable.cork()` is to accommodate a situation in which several small chunks are written to the stream in rapid succession. Instead of immediately forwarding them to the underlying destination, `writable.cork()` buffers all the chunks until `writable.uncork()` is called, which will pass them all to `writable._writev()`, if present. This prevents a head-of-line blocking situation where data is being buffered while waiting for the first small chunk to be processed. However, use of `writable.cork()` without implementing `writable._writev()` may have an adverse effect on throughput.

    See also: `writable.uncork()`, `writable._writev()`.

    Once `destroy()` has been called any further calls will be a no-op and no further errors except from `_destroy()` may be emitted as `'error'`.

    Implementors should not override this method, but instead implement `readable._destroy()`.

  + [final](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/final)(): NonSharedBuffer;

    Once the `decipher.final()` method has been called, the `Decipheriv` object can no longer be used to decrypt data. Attempts to call `decipher.final()` more than once will result in an error being thrown.

    @returns

    Any remaining deciphered contents. If `outputEncoding` is specified, a string is returned. If an `outputEncoding` is not provided, a Buffer is returned.

    [final](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/final)(

    ): string;

    Once the `decipher.final()` method has been called, the `Decipheriv` object can no longer be used to decrypt data. Attempts to call `decipher.final()` more than once will result in an error being thrown.

    @param outputEncoding

    The `encoding` of the return value.

    @returns

    Any remaining deciphered contents. If `outputEncoding` is specified, a string is returned. If an `outputEncoding` is not provided, a Buffer is returned.

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<undefined | T>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.find` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream to find a chunk with a truthy value for *fn*. Once an *fn* call's awaited return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with value for which *fn* returned a truthy value. If all of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a falsy value, the promise is fulfilled with `undefined`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise evaluating to the first chunk for which *fn* evaluated with a truthy value, or `undefined` if no element was found.

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.find` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream to find a chunk with a truthy value for *fn*. Once an *fn* call's awaited return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with value for which *fn* returned a truthy value.

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method returns a new stream by applying the given callback to each chunk of the stream and then flattening the result.

    It is possible to return a stream or another iterable or async iterable from *fn* and the result streams will be merged (flattened) into the returned stream.

    @param fn

    a function to map over every chunk in the stream. May be async. May be a stream or generator.

    @returns

    a stream flat-mapped with the function *fn*.
  + [forEach](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/forEach)(

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<void>;

    This method allows iterating a stream. For each chunk in the stream the *fn* function will be called. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed.

    This method is different from `for await...of` loops in that it can optionally process chunks concurrently. In addition, a `forEach` iteration can only be stopped by having passed a `signal` option and aborting the related AbortController while `for await...of` can be stopped with `break` or `return`. In either case the stream will be destroyed.

    This method is different from listening to the `'data'` event in that it uses the `readable` event in the underlying machinary and can limit the number of concurrent *fn* calls.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    @returns

    a promise for when the stream has finished.
  + [getMaxListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/getMaxListeners)(): number;

    Returns the current max listener value for the `EventEmitter` which is either set by `emitter.setMaxListeners(n)` or defaults to EventEmitter.defaultMaxListeners.
  + [isPaused](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/isPaused)(): boolean;

    The `readable.isPaused()` method returns the current operating state of the `Readable`. This is used primarily by the mechanism that underlies the `readable.pipe()` method. In most typical cases, there will be no reason to use this method directly.

    ```
    const readable = new stream.Readable();

    readable.isPaused(); // === false
    readable.pause();
    readable.isPaused(); // === true
    readable.resume();
    readable.isPaused(); // === false
    ```
  + [iterator](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/iterator)(

    options?: { destroyOnReturn: boolean }

    ): AsyncIterator<any>;

    The iterator created by this method gives users the option to cancel the destruction of the stream if the `for await...of` loop is exited by `return`, `break`, or `throw`, or if the iterator should destroy the stream if the stream emitted an error during iteration.
  + [listenerCount](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/listenerCount)<K>(

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): [Readable](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/Readable);

    This method allows mapping over the stream. The *fn* function will be called for every chunk in the stream. If the *fn* function returns a promise - that promise will be `await`ed before being passed to the result stream.

    @param fn

    a function to map over every chunk in the stream. Async or not.

    event: 'close',

    listener: () => void

    ): this;

    Adds the `listener` function to the end of the listeners array for the event named `eventName`. No checks are made to see if the `listener` has already been added. Multiple calls passing the same combination of `eventName` and `listener` will result in the `listener` being added, and called, multiple times.

    ```
    server.on('connection', (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    });
    ```

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

    By default, event listeners are invoked in the order they are added. The `emitter.prependListener()` method can be used as an alternative to add the event listener to the beginning of the listeners array.

  + [read](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/read)(

    size?: number

    ): any;

    The `readable.read()` method reads data out of the internal buffer and returns it. If no data is available to be read, `null` is returned. By default, the data is returned as a `Buffer` object unless an encoding has been specified using the `readable.setEncoding()` method or the stream is operating in object mode.

    The optional `size` argument specifies a specific number of bytes to read. If `size` bytes are not available to be read, `null` will be returned *unless* the stream has ended, in which case all of the data remaining in the internal buffer will be returned.

    If the `size` argument is not specified, all of the data contained in the internal buffer will be returned.

    The `size` argument must be less than or equal to 1 GiB.

    The `readable.read()` method should only be called on `Readable` streams operating in paused mode. In flowing mode, `readable.read()` is called automatically until the internal buffer is fully drained.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();

    // 'readable' may be triggered multiple times as data is buffered in
    readable.on('readable', () => {
      let chunk;
      console.log('Stream is readable (new data received in buffer)');
      // Use a loop to make sure we read all currently available data
      while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
        console.log(`Read ${chunk.length} bytes of data...`);
      }
    });

    // 'end' will be triggered once when there is no more data available
    readable.on('end', () => {
      console.log('Reached end of stream.');
    });
    ```

    Each call to `readable.read()` returns a chunk of data, or `null`. The chunks are not concatenated. A `while` loop is necessary to consume all data currently in the buffer. When reading a large file `.read()` may return `null`, having consumed all buffered content so far, but there is still more data to come not yet buffered. In this case a new `'readable'` event will be emitted when there is more data in the buffer. Finally the `'end'` event will be emitted when there is no more data to come.

    Therefore to read a file's whole contents from a `readable`, it is necessary to collect chunks across multiple `'readable'` events:

    ```
    const chunks = [];

    readable.on('readable', () => {
      let chunk;
      while (null !== (chunk = readable.read())) {
        chunks.push(chunk);
      }
    });

    readable.on('end', () => {
      const content = chunks.join('');
    });
    ```

    A `Readable` stream in object mode will always return a single item from a call to `readable.read(size)`, regardless of the value of the `size` argument.

    If the `readable.read()` method returns a chunk of data, a `'data'` event will also be emitted.

    Calling read after the `'end'` event has been emitted will return `null`. No runtime error will be raised.

    This method calls *fn* on each chunk of the stream in order, passing it the result from the calculation on the previous element. It returns a promise for the final value of the reduction.

    If no *initial* value is supplied the first chunk of the stream is used as the initial value. If the stream is empty, the promise is rejected with a `TypeError` with the `ERR_INVALID_ARGS` code property.

    The reducer function iterates the stream element-by-element which means that there is no *concurrency* parameter or parallelism. To perform a reduce concurrently, you can extract the async function to `readable.map` method.

    @param fn

    a reducer function to call over every chunk in the stream. Async or not.

    @param initial

    the initial value to use in the reduction.

  + [removeAllListeners](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/removeAllListeners)(

    eventName?: string | symbol

    ): this;

    Removes all listeners, or those of the specified `eventName`.

    It is bad practice to remove listeners added elsewhere in the code, particularly when the `EventEmitter` instance was created by some other component or module (e.g. sockets or file streams).

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
  + [removeListener](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/removeListener)(

    event: 'close',

    listener: () => void

    ): this;

    Removes the specified `listener` from the listener array for the event named `eventName`.

    ```
    const callback = (stream) => {
      console.log('someone connected!');
    };
    server.on('connection', callback);
    // ...
    server.removeListener('connection', callback);
    ```

    `removeListener()` will remove, at most, one instance of a listener from the listener array. If any single listener has been added multiple times to the listener array for the specified `eventName`, then `removeListener()` must be called multiple times to remove each instance.

    Once an event is emitted, all listeners attached to it at the time of emitting are called in order. This implies that any `removeListener()` or `removeAllListeners()` calls *after* emitting and *before* the last listener finishes execution will not remove them from`emit()` in progress. Subsequent events behave as expected.

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}
    const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

    const callbackA = () => {
      console.log('A');
      myEmitter.removeListener('event', callbackB);
    };

    const callbackB = () => {
      console.log('B');
    };

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackA);

    myEmitter.on('event', callbackB);

    // callbackA removes listener callbackB but it will still be called.
    // Internal listener array at time of emit [callbackA, callbackB]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    //   B

    // callbackB is now removed.
    // Internal listener array [callbackA]
    myEmitter.emit('event');
    // Prints:
    //   A
    ```

    Because listeners are managed using an internal array, calling this will change the position indices of any listener registered *after* the listener being removed. This will not impact the order in which listeners are called, but it means that any copies of the listener array as returned by the `emitter.listeners()` method will need to be recreated.

    When a single function has been added as a handler multiple times for a single event (as in the example below), `removeListener()` will remove the most recently added instance. In the example the `once('ping')` listener is removed:

    ```
    import { EventEmitter } from 'node:events';
    const ee = new EventEmitter();

    function pong() {
      console.log('pong');
    }

    ee.on('ping', pong);
    ee.once('ping', pong);
    ee.removeListener('ping', pong);

    ee.emit('ping');
    ee.emit('ping');
    ```

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

  + [resume](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/resume)(): this;

    The `readable.resume()` method causes an explicitly paused `Readable` stream to resume emitting `'data'` events, switching the stream into flowing mode.

    The `readable.resume()` method can be used to fully consume the data from a stream without actually processing any of that data:

    ```
    getReadableStreamSomehow()
      .resume()
      .on('end', () => {
        console.log('Reached the end, but did not read anything.');
      });

    The `readable.resume()` method has no effect if there is a `'readable'` event listener.

    When data has been encrypted without standard block padding, calling `decipher.setAutoPadding(false)` will disable automatic padding to prevent `decipher.final()` from checking for and removing padding.

    Turning auto padding off will only work if the input data's length is a multiple of the ciphers block size.

    The `decipher.setAutoPadding()` method must be called before `decipher.final()`.

  + [setDefaultEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/setDefaultEncoding)(

    @param encoding

    The new default encoding
  + [setEncoding](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/setEncoding)(

    encoding: BufferEncoding

    ): this;

    The `readable.setEncoding()` method sets the character encoding for data read from the `Readable` stream.

    By default, no encoding is assigned and stream data will be returned as `Buffer` objects. Setting an encoding causes the stream data to be returned as strings of the specified encoding rather than as `Buffer` objects. For instance, calling `readable.setEncoding('utf8')` will cause the output data to be interpreted as UTF-8 data, and passed as strings. Calling `readable.setEncoding('hex')` will cause the data to be encoded in hexadecimal string format.

    The `Readable` stream will properly handle multi-byte characters delivered through the stream that would otherwise become improperly decoded if simply pulled from the stream as `Buffer` objects.

    ```
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
    readable.setEncoding('utf8');
    readable.on('data', (chunk) => {
      assert.equal(typeof chunk, 'string');

    ): this;

    By default `EventEmitter`s will print a warning if more than `10` listeners are added for a particular event. This is a useful default that helps finding memory leaks. The `emitter.setMaxListeners()` method allows the limit to be modified for this specific `EventEmitter` instance. The value can be set to `Infinity` (or `0`) to indicate an unlimited number of listeners.

    Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

    options?: [ArrayOptions](https://bun.com/reference/node/stream/default/ArrayOptions)

    ): Promise<boolean>;

    This method is similar to `Array.prototype.some` and calls *fn* on each chunk in the stream until the awaited return value is `true` (or any truthy value). Once an *fn* call on a chunk `await`ed return value is truthy, the stream is destroyed and the promise is fulfilled with `true`. If none of the *fn* calls on the chunks return a truthy value, the promise is fulfilled with `false`.

    @param fn

    a function to call on each chunk of the stream. Async or not.

    ): Promise<any[]>;

    This method allows easily obtaining the contents of a stream.

    As this method reads the entire stream into memory, it negates the benefits of streams. It's intended for interoperability and convenience, not as the primary way to consume streams.

    @returns

    a promise containing an array with the contents of the stream.
  + [uncork](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/uncork)(): void;

    The `writable.uncork()` method flushes all data buffered since cork was called.

    When using `writable.cork()` and `writable.uncork()` to manage the buffering of writes to a stream, defer calls to `writable.uncork()` using `process.nextTick()`. Doing so allows batching of all `writable.write()` calls that occur within a given Node.js event loop phase.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => stream.uncork());
    ```

    If the `writable.cork()` method is called multiple times on a stream, the same number of calls to `writable.uncork()` must be called to flush the buffered data.

    ```
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('some ');
    stream.cork();
    stream.write('data ');
    process.nextTick(() => {
      stream.uncork();
      // The data will not be flushed until uncork() is called a second time.
      stream.uncork();
    });
    ```

    See also: `writable.cork()`.
  + [unpipe](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/unpipe)(

    destination?: WritableStream

    ): this;

    The `readable.unpipe()` method detaches a `Writable` stream previously attached using the pipe method.

    If the `destination` is not specified, then *all* pipes are detached.

    If the `destination` is specified, but no pipe is set up for it, then the method does nothing.

    ```
    import fs from 'node:fs';
    const readable = getReadableStreamSomehow();
    const writable = fs.createWriteStream('file.txt');
    // All the data from readable goes into 'file.txt',
    // but only for the first second.
    readable.pipe(writable);
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('Stop writing to file.txt.');
      readable.unpipe(writable);
      console.log('Manually close the file stream.');
      writable.end();
    }, 1000);
    ```

    @param destination

    Optional specific stream to unpipe
  + [unshift](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/unshift)(

    chunk: any,

    encoding?: BufferEncoding

    ): void;

    Passing `chunk` as `null` signals the end of the stream (EOF) and behaves the same as `readable.push(null)`, after which no more data can be written. The EOF signal is put at the end of the buffer and any buffered data will still be flushed.

    The `readable.unshift()` method pushes a chunk of data back into the internal buffer. This is useful in certain situations where a stream is being consumed by code that needs to "un-consume" some amount of data that it has optimistically pulled out of the source, so that the data can be passed on to some other party.

    The `stream.unshift(chunk)` method cannot be called after the `'end'` event has been emitted or a runtime error will be thrown.

    Developers using `stream.unshift()` often should consider switching to use of a `Transform` stream instead. See the `API for stream implementers` section for more information.

    ```
    // Pull off a header delimited by \n\n.
    // Use unshift() if we get too much.
    // Call the callback with (error, header, stream).
    import { StringDecoder } from 'node:string_decoder';
    function parseHeader(stream, callback) {
      stream.on('error', callback);
      stream.on('readable', onReadable);
      const decoder = new StringDecoder('utf8');
      let header = '';
      function onReadable() {
        let chunk;
        while (null !== (chunk = stream.read())) {
          const str = decoder.write(chunk);
          if (str.includes('\n\n')) {
            // Found the header boundary.
            const split = str.split(/\n\n/);
            header += split.shift();
            const remaining = split.join('\n\n');
            const buf = Buffer.from(remaining, 'utf8');
            stream.removeListener('error', callback);
            // Remove the 'readable' listener before unshifting.
            stream.removeListener('readable', onReadable);
            if (buf.length)
              stream.unshift(buf);
            // Now the body of the message can be read from the stream.
            callback(null, header, stream);
            return;
          }
          // Still reading the header.
          header += str;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Unlike push, `stream.unshift(chunk)` will not end the reading process by resetting the internal reading state of the stream. This can cause unexpected results if `readable.unshift()` is called during a read (i.e. from within a \_read implementation on a custom stream). Following the call to `readable.unshift()` with an immediate push will reset the reading state appropriately, however it is best to simply avoid calling `readable.unshift()` while in the process of performing a read.

    @param chunk

    Chunk of data to unshift onto the read queue. For streams not operating in object mode, `chunk` must be a {string}, {Buffer}, {TypedArray}, {DataView} or `null`. For object mode streams, `chunk` may be any JavaScript value.

  + [wrap](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/wrap)(

    stream: ReadableStream

    ): this;

    Prior to Node.js 0.10, streams did not implement the entire `node:stream` module API as it is currently defined. (See `Compatibility` for more information.)

    When using an older Node.js library that emits `'data'` events and has a pause method that is advisory only, the `readable.wrap()` method can be used to create a `Readable` stream that uses the old stream as its data source.

    It will rarely be necessary to use `readable.wrap()` but the method has been provided as a convenience for interacting with older Node.js applications and libraries.

    ```
    import { OldReader } from './old-api-module.js';
    import { Readable } from 'node:stream';
    const oreader = new OldReader();
    const myReader = new Readable().wrap(oreader);

      myReader.read(); // etc.
    });
    ```

  + [write](https://bun.com/reference/node/crypto/DecipherOCB/write)(

    chunk: any,

    callback?: (error: undefined | null | [Error](https://bun.com/reference/globals/Error)) => void

    ): boolean;

    The `writable.write()` method writes some data to the stream, and calls the supplied `callback` once the data has been fully handled. If an error occurs, the `callback` will be called with the error as its first argument. The `callback` is called asynchronously and before `'error'` is emitted.

    The return value is `true` if the internal buffer is less than the `highWaterMark` configured when the stream was created after admitting `chunk`. If `false` is returned, further attempts to write data to the stream should stop until the `'drain'` event is emitted.

    While a stream is not draining, calls to `write()` will buffer `chunk`, and return false. Once all currently buffered chunks are drained (accepted for delivery by the operating system), the `'drain'` event will be emitted. Once `write()` returns false, do not write more chunks until the `'drain'` event is emitted. While calling `write()` on a stream that is not draining is allowed, Node.js will buffer all written chunks until maximum memory usage occurs, at which point it will abort unconditionally. Even before it aborts, high memory usage will cause poor garbage collector performance and high RSS (which is not typically released back to the system, even after the memory is no longer required). Since TCP sockets may never drain if the remote peer does not read the data, writing a socket that is not draining may lead to a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

    Writing data while the stream is not draining is particularly problematic for a `Transform`, because the `Transform` streams are paused by default until they are piped or a `'data'` or `'readable'` event handler is added.

    If the data to be written can be generated or fetched on demand, it is recommended to encapsulate the logic into a `Readable` and use pipe. However, if calling `write()` is preferred, it is possible to respect backpressure and avoid memory issues using the `'drain'` event:

    ```
    function write(data, cb) {
      if (!stream.write(data)) {
        stream.once('drain', cb);
      } else {
        process.nextTick(cb);
      }
    }

    // Wait for cb to be called before doing any other write.
    write('hello', () => {
      console.log('Write completed, do more writes now.');
    });
    ```

    A `Writable` stream in object mode will always ignore the `encoding` argument.

    @param chunk

    Optional data to write. For streams not operating in object mode, `chunk` must be a {string}, {Buffer}, {TypedArray} or {DataView}. For object mode streams, `chunk` may be any JavaScript value other than `null`.

    @param callback

    Callback for when this chunk of data is flushed.

    @returns

    `false` if the stream wishes for the calling code to wait for the `'drain'` event to be emitted before continuing to write additional data; otherwise `true`.

    The return value is `true` if the internal buffer is less than the `highWaterMark` configured when the stream was created after admitting `chunk`. If `false` is returned, further attempts to write data to the stream should stop until the `'drain'` event is emitted.

    While a stream is not draining, calls to `write()` will buffer `chunk`, and return false. Once all currently buffered chunks are drained (accepted for delivery by the operating system), the `'drain'` event will be emitted. Once `write()` returns false, do not write more chunks until the `'drain'` event is emitted. While calling `write()` on a stream that is not draining is allowed, Node.js will buffer all written chunks until maximum memory usage occurs, at which point it will abort unconditionally. Even before it aborts, high memory usage will cause poor garbage collector performance and high RSS (which is not typically released back to the system, even after the memory is no longer required). Since TCP sockets may never drain if the remote peer does not read the data, writing a socket that is not draining may lead to a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

    Writing data while the stream is not draining is particularly problematic for a `Transform`, because the `Transform` streams are paused by default until they are piped or a `'data'` or `'readable'` event handler is added.

    If the data to be written can be generated or fetched on demand, it is recommended to encapsulate the logic into a `Readable` and use pipe. However, if calling `write()` is preferred, it is possible to respect backpressure and avoid memory issues using the `'drain'` event:

    ```
    function write(data, cb) {
      if (!stream.write(data)) {
        stream.once('drain', cb);
      } else {
        process.nextTick(cb);
      }
    }

    // Wait for cb to be called before doing any other write.
    write('hello', () => {
      console.log('Write completed, do more writes now.');
    });
    ```

    A `Writable` stream in object mode will always ignore the `encoding` argument.

    @param chunk

    Optional data to write. For streams not operating in object mode, `chunk` must be a {string}, {Buffer}, {TypedArray} or {DataView}. For object mode streams, `chunk` may be any JavaScript value other than `null`.

    @param encoding

    The encoding, if `chunk` is a string.

    @param callback

    Callback for when this chunk of data is flushed.

    @returns

    `false` if the stream wishes for the calling code to wait for the `'drain'` event to be emitted before continuing to write additional data; otherwise `true`.
