## [Fixed: Crash when using Prisma](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.28#fixed-crash-when-using-prisma)

A crash when using Prisma with multiple simultaneous N-API calls from different modules has been fixed. This crash would reproduce when using Prisma and `@napi-rs/canvas` in the same microtask tick.

This crash was caused by an incorrect implementation of `napi_create_reference`. Previously, we assumed that only one napi reference would be associated with an individual object created from napi, but that assumption was incorrect. This led to a crash when creating a napi reference for the same object multiple times.

Thanks to [@camero2734](https://github.com/camero2734) for fixing this.

## [Fixed: Astro v4.4 throwing an error](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.28#fixed-astro-v4-4-throwing-an-error)

In Bun v1.0.27, we fixed a bug where Astro v4.4 would render empty pages – but our fix was incomplete. An error would occur when multiple pages were being rendered simultaneosly.

This occurred because we made an incorrect assumption. We assumed that the `[Symbol.asyncIterator]` function could be called in `pull` of the ReadableStream, but Astro expected it to be called immediately. This bug manifested when multiple pages were being rendered simultaneously.

Thanks to [@paperclover](https://github.com/paperclover) for fixing this.

## [Fixed: describe.only + nested describe/test](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.28#fixed-describe-only-nested-describe-test)

Previously, the test `my test here` would not run in the following code:

```
describe.only("outer", () => {
  describe("inner", () => {
    test("my test here", () => {
      expect(1).toBe(1);
    });
  });
});
```

The bug was that `describe.only` was not propagating to nested non-describe.only blocks. This has been fixed.

## [Fixed: `--only` flag with test.each](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.28#fixed-only-flag-with-test-each)

Previously, the test.each block would run in the following code:

```
describe.only("outer", () => {});

test.each([1, 2, 3])("my test %d here should never run!", () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1);
});
```

This was a bug! test.each should not have run. This bug has been fixed.

## [node:readline & node:events.on bugfixes](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.28#node-readline-node-events-on-bugfixes)

Thanks to [@yschroe](https://github.com/yschroe), this release includes 3 bugfixes for node:readline and node:events.on:

* Fixes a bug in events.on which causes events to be skipped
* Fixes readline does not read all line when looping with iterator
* Fixes readline module yields wrong and incomplete values with a bad performance

## [node:http2 bugfix](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.28#node-http2-bugfix)

Previously, passing a header that can only be one value (like `Authorization`) via an array of one element (like `['Bearer token']`) would throw an error in node:http2. This has been fixed. Now it only throws if truly multiple values are passed in.

This bug impacted Firebase & Firestore. There are still bugs blocking Firebase & Firestore from being usable in Bun, but this gets us closer.

## [Bun Shell stdin redirect bugfix](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.28#bun-shell-stdin-redirect-bugfix)

Bun Shell was not handling stdin redirection to file paths correctly. Thanks to [@zackradisic](https://github.com/zackradisic) for fixing this.

## [Windows is not ready yet](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.28#windows-is-not-ready-yet)

We are still working on Windows. There's a big PR we aim to merge on Wednesday, which will get us closer.
