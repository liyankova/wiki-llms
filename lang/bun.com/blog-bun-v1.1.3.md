### [Windows support improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.3#windows-support-improvements)

## [Up to 50% faster `bun install` on Windows](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.3#up-to-50-faster-bun-install-on-windows)

In this release, `bun install` gets up to 50% faster at installing packages on Windows compared to Bun v1.1.2 and earlier.

For an application which has `next`, SvelteKit, and a handful more in package.json:

```
PS > hyperfine "bun install --ignore-scripts" "bun-1.1.2.exe install --ignore-scripts" --prepare="rm -r node_modules || true" --warmup=2

Benchmark 1: bun install --ignore-scripts # New
  Time (mean ± σ):     720.7 ms ±  39.8 ms    [User: 20.3 ms, System: 423.4 ms]
  Range (min … max):   676.4 ms … 801.9 ms    10 runs

Benchmark 2: bun-1.1.2.exe install --ignore-scripts # Old
  Time (mean ± σ):      1.158 s ±  0.017 s    [User: 0.011 s, System: 0.419 s]
  Range (min … max):    1.135 s …  1.180 s    10 runs

Summary
  bun install --ignore-scripts ran
    1.61 ± 0.09 times faster than bun-1.1.2.exe install --ignore-scripts
```

We've paralellized some of where `bun install` copies/hardlinks files on Windows, but not all of them.

Bun for Windows is still compiled using `ReleaseSafe` mode which adds runtime safety checks that can cause some performance issues. Once there are fewer bug reports in bundows, we'll switch to `ReleaseFast` mode.

## [Fixed: CTRL + C on cmd.exe after exiting bun](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.3#fixed-ctrl-c-on-cmd-exe-after-exiting-bun)

One difference between `cmd.exe` and PowerShell is the console mode. On exit, PowerShell always resets the console mode. Command Prompt (cmd.exe) does not.

Previously, bun wasn't resetting the console mode on exit. This would cause issues with pressing Up or Down arrows in Command Prompt after exiting bun.

This has been fixed.

## [Fixed: Potential crash when loading modules without permissions](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.3#fixed-potential-crash-when-loading-modules-without-permissions)

A bug that could cause loading a JavaScript or TypeScript file to crash if the file was not readable has been fixed.

This bug was caused by assuming the permission was accessible when it wasn't.

### [bun install improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.3#bun-install-improvements)

## [Fixed: Spurious "Install failed" error](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.3#fixed-spurious-install-failed-error)

When installing packages with a nested node\_modules folder where the parent package needs to be downloaded along with a number of more subtle conditions, bun install would sometimes fail with an "Install failed" error.

This has been fixed.

## [Fixed: Non-zero exit code after errors](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.3#fixed-non-zero-exit-code-after-errors)

Some errors in `bun install` didn't cause bun to exit with a non-zero exit code. This has been fixed.

Most of the errors where this would happen had to do with filesystem permissions.

## [Fixed: Potential deadlock in `bun install`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.3#fixed-potential-deadlock-in-bun-install)

A rare deadlock in `bun install` has been fixed. This would happen potentially if many packages finished extracting at the exact same time and for some reason the main thread did not wake up when notified.
