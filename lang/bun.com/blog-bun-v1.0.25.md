## [Fixed: crash in fs.readFile](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.25#fixed-crash-in-fs-readfile)

In certain cases, Bun would crash when reading a file with `fs.readFile`, `fs.readFileSync`, or `fs.promises.readFile`. This was caused by an unintiailized memory access introduced when Bun added support for standalone modules.

## [Fixed: crash in Bun.file().text()](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.25#fixed-crash-in-bun-file-text)

A crash when reading a file with `Bun.file().text()` that had a Byte Order Mark has been fixed. This crash was introduced in Bun v1.0.24.

## [Fixed: crash in IPC](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.25#fixed-crash-in-ipc)

A crash in IPC that would occur 4-5 seconds after the process started has been fixed. This crash was introduced when upgrading our version of uSockets to gain "long timeout" support. The crash was a null-pointer dereference when calling the timeout callback.

## [Fixed: transpiler loose equality comparison bug](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.25#fixed-transpiler-loose-equality-comparison-bug)

The following input would be constant-folded incorrectly:

```
"" == 0;
"-0" == 0;
1234n == 5678n;
```

This has been fixed, thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway).

## [`vm.createScript`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.25#vm-createscript)

The `node:vm` function `createScript` has been added. This calls `new vm.Script` with the same arguments.

## [Windows is coming soon](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.25#windows-is-coming-soon)

10 days away.
