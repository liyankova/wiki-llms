## [New: `install.saveTextLockfile` in bunfig.toml](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.40#new-install-savetextlockfile-in-bunfig-toml)

In Bun v1.1.39, we introduced the [text-based `bun.lock` lockfile](https://bun.sh/blog/bun-lock-text-lockfile) format for `bun install`. In Bun v1.2, we will make it the default.

To use `bun.lock` instead of `bun.lockb`:

```
bun install --save-text-lockfile
```

Several people have asked for a way to use the text-based lockfile format by default without waiting for v1.2.

You can now set `install.saveTextLockfile = true` in your `bunfig.toml` to make the text lockfile format the default.

~/.bunfig.toml

```
[install]
saveTextLockfile = true
```

You can place this in your global `~/.bunfig.toml`.

## [Fixed: regression in process.on from Bun v1.1.39](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.40#fixed-regression-in-process-on-from-bun-v1-1-39)

A regression introduced in Bun v1.1.39 caused `process.on` when used in a Worker, in a single-file executable, or a macro to potentially crash. This has been fixed.

Thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) for implementing this!

## [Fixed: N-API BigInt handling bug impacting DuckDB](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.40#fixed-n-api-bigint-handling-bug-impacting-duckdb)

Our N-API implementation for `napi_create_bigint_words` was not handling trailing zeros consistently with Node.js & V8.

The `napi_get_value_bigint_uint64` and `napi_get_value_bigint_int64` functions were not setting the `lossless` boolean flag.

These have been fixed, thanks to [@190n](https://github.com/190n)!

## [Improved git/github dependency installation reliability](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.40#improved-git-github-dependency-installation-reliability)

In rare cases, `bun install` would hang or fail to install git/github dependencies.

What makes Git/GitHub dependencies tricky is we don't know their own dependencies until after we've downloaded the package (unlike npm which has a registry API we can ask ahead of time). To save you time, bandwidth, and disk space, `bun install` goes to great lengths to avoid downloading packages that ultimately won't be used or are already installed. Often `bun install` won't try to download a package until we try to install it, see it's not there in node\_modules, and see it's not there in the global store.

This release fixes a bug that could cause git dependencies to fail to transition from the downloading state to the installed state. This release also fixes a bug in package-lock.json migration when manually changing npm URLs to git URLs.

Thank to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) for implementing this!

## [WebKit upgrade](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.40#webkit-upgrade)

This WebKit upgrade includes reliability and security improvements.

* A lock could theoretically unlock too early
* An edgecase involving the DFG JIT with the `[[ToString]]` operation
* Setting a value in a typed array of integers in the DFG JIT could end up in an incorrect state in the global object when taking a slow path
