Bun v0.8.1 adds unix domain socket support for Bun.serve(), fixes a performance regression, and fixes bugs in bun install, node:http and napi.

Bun 1.0 is coming on September 7th! Register for the launch stream at <https://bun.sh/1.0>.

Bun is an incredibly fast JavaScript runtime, bundler, transpiler, and package manager — all in one. We've been releasing a lot of changes to Bun recently. Here's a recap of the last few releases. In case you missed it:

* [`v0.7.0`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.7.0) - Web Workers, `--smol`, `structuredClone()`, WebSocket reliability improvements, `node:tls` fixes, and more.
* [`v0.7.1`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.7.1) - ES Modules load 30-250% faster, `fs.watch` fixes, and lots of `node:fs` compatibility improvements.
* [`v0.7.2`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.7.1) - Implements `node:worker_threads`, `node:diagnostics_channel`, and [`BroadcastChannel`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel).

## [Start an HTTP server on a unix domain socket with Bun.serve()](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.1#start-an-http-server-on-a-unix-domain-socket-with-bun-serve)

`Bun.serve()` now supports [unix domain sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket), which let you point a socket to a file on your filesystem instead of a network host/port. This is useful when you want to run a server that's only accessible from the same machine, sometimes containers or proxies.

server.ts

```
const server = Bun.serve({
  unix: "/tmp/my-socket.sock", // <-- new option
  fetch(req){
    console.log(req.url);
    return new Response("Hello world!");
  }
});

console.log(`Listening on unix:///tmp/my-socket.sock!`);
```

To start the server, run `bun ./server.ts`.

```
bun ./server.ts
```

```
Listening on unix:///tmp/my-socket.sock!
```

Then, you can use `curl` to make a request to the socket.

```
curl --unix-socket /tmp/my-socket.sock http://localhost/my-path
```

```
Hello world!
```

## [Performance regression in reading request bodies fixed](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.1#performance-regression-in-reading-request-bodies-fixed)

Bun v0.8.0 (released yesterday) introduced a performance regression in reading request bodies. This has been fixed in v0.8.1.

The following script:

```
Bun.serve({
  port: 3000,
  async fetch(request) {
    await request.json();
    return new Response();
  },
});
```

Bun v0.8.1:

```
❯ oha http://localhost:3000 -m POST -d '{"a": 123}' -n 200000
Summary:
  Success rate:	1.0000
  Total:	1.8099 secs
  Slowest:	0.0068 secs
  Fastest:	0.0000 secs
  Average:	0.0005 secs
  Requests/sec:	110505.0574
```

Bun v0.8.0:

```
❯ oha http://localhost:3000 -m POST -d '{"a": 123}' -n 200000
Summary:
  Success rate:	1.0000
  Total:	5.1787 secs
  Slowest:	0.0121 secs
  Fastest:	0.0002 secs
  Average:	0.0013 secs
  Requests/sec:	38619.4133
```

That's a 2.8x regression!

The problem was microtask scheduling.

### [Microtask scheduling](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.1#microtask-scheduling)

In Bun v0.8, we fixed a longstanding inefficiency in event loop scheduling with the HTTP server & sockets, but missed one case that caused this regression.

JavaScript's event loop has two types of tasks: microtasks and tasks.

| Task | Microtask |
| --- | --- |
| `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, async I/O | `queueMicrotask`, `Promise.resolve`, `process.nextTick` |

Microtasks are scheduled with `queueMicrotask()`, `Promise.resolve()`, `process.nextTick`, and a few other APIs.

Tasks are scheduled with `setTimeout()`, `setInterval()`, or by async I/O (such as the HTTP server). Tasks keep the process alive, and microtasks are drained at the end of each task.

You can think of JavaScript's event loop as being a more complicated version of this:

```
let task;
while ((task = getNextTask())) {
  task();

  do {
    let microtask;
    while ((microtask = getNextMicrotask())) {
      microtask();
    }
  } while (hasMicrotasks());
}
```

Each task potentially schedules many more microtasks and tasks. Microtasks are drained at the end of each task, and tasks are drained at the end of each event loop iteration.

Bun's event loop previously worked something more like this:

```
while (true) {
  let task;
  while ((task = getNextTask())) {
    task();

    do {
      let microtask;
      while ((microtask = getNextMicrotask())) {
        microtask();
      }
    } while (hasMicrotasks());
  }

  while ((task = getAsyncIOTask())) {
    task();

    // where's the microtask draining? 🤔
  }
}
```

For async IO, we were not draining microtasks! This led to a lot of unnecessary microtask scheduling, which caused excessive memory usage and delays in certain cases.

But that was not the cause of the performance regression after v0.8.0.

The performance regression was because we forgot to drain microtasks when reading request bodies.

This meant that for every request body, we would schedule a microtask to read the body, and then only drain it sometime later when the next task was scheduled. In < Bun v0.8.0, microtasks created in the HTTP server were drained only after all other tasks completed. That meant that missing microtask draining was consistent everywhere. In Bun v0.8.0, microtasks created in the HTTP server were drained after the current request completed, which means skipping it in this case (reading request bodies) would be unbalanced. It caused this performance regression.

## [bun install bugfix in malformed version name](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.1#bun-install-bugfix-in-malformed-version-name)

The `^0.0.2rc1` verison specifier is invalid, but exists in the wild in npm. Previously, Bun would crash when given this input and that has been fixed.

## [Statically-known failing `require` mistakenly inlined at runtime](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.1#statically-known-failing-require-mistakenly-inlined-at-runtime)

Bun's bundler automatically inlines failing `require()` calls when it knows that they will fail at runtime and are inside a try/catch block. This is useful for bundling code that uses optional dependencies.

Input:

```
try {
  require("i-dont-exist-but-thats-okay");
} catch (e) {
  console.log("I don't exist, but that's okay!");
}
```

Output:

```
try {
  (() => {
    // the bug! it shouldn't be inlined here. it should only be inlined when bundling.
    throw new Error(`Cannot require module "i-dont-exist-but-thats-okay"`);
  })();
} catch (e) {
  console.log("I don't exist, but that's okay!");
}
```

This feature was mistakenly enabled at runtime, not just when bundling. This broke some packages that rely on checking for the existence of a module or checking for the specific `code` property exposed by Node.js. That has been fixed. Bun's runtime no longer inlines failing `require()` calls (bundler still does, which is correct)

This bug mostly impacted napi.

## [Reduced memory usage when there are lots of Headers & Blob objects](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.1#reduced-memory-usage-when-there-are-lots-of-headers-blob-objects)

Bun's `Headers` and `Blob` implementations were not reporting their size to the garbage collector. Since Bun implements many classes in native code, the garbage collector cannot always see how much memory is really being used by a class. When `Headers` or `Blob` are large enough, this can cause the garbage collector to not run as often as it should be.

Now Bun reports the size of `Headers` and `Blob` to the garbage collector.

## [fetch() memory reporting bugfix](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.1#fetch-memory-reporting-bugfix)

Currently, every call to `fetch()` uses about 3 KB of memory. This memory is used in native code, which means it wasn't visible to the garbage collector. Now Bun reports this memory to the garbage collector, which means that the garbage collector will run more often when there are lots of `fetch()` calls.

## [bun install bugfix with stale package.json scripts](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.1#bun-install-bugfix-with-stale-package-json-scripts)

`bun install`'s lockfile is binary, which lets us store more data than usual in a lockfile. One of the things we store is the `package.json` scripts. Previously, if you ran `bun install` and then changed the `package.json` scripts, `bun install` would not always pick up the changes. This has been fixed.

## [Sourcemap bugfix in `bun --inspect`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.1#sourcemap-bugfix-in-bun-inspect)

Since Bun transpiles every file, Bun must also keep a sourcemap for every file. This is used to make `Error.prototype.stack` produce sourcemapped stacktraces and `console.log` to report accurate line numbers.

Sourcemaps unfortunately cost a lot of memory. Instead of storing the entire sourcemap in memory, we store a more compact version until it's first used. The first 24 bytes of the compact version contains extra metadata (such as, the number of lines the original input source code had). This 24 byte header was mistakenly being included in the inline sourcemaps used in `bun --inspect`, leading to invalid input in the first 24 bytes or so of the JSON sourcemap. Surprisingly, this didn't consistently break sourcemaps. Only sometimes. Regardless, it has been fixed and now Bun includes the sourcemap bytes as expected, without the extra metadata.

## [Proxy URL with node:http bug has been fixed](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.8.1#proxy-url-with-node-http-bug-has-been-fixed)

When the following script was run with a `http_proxy` environment variable set, an error was thrown:

Script:

```
import axios from "axios";

const res = await axios.get("https://httpbin.org/get?answer=42");

console.log(res.data.args);
```

Run:

```
http_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:1087 https_proxy=http://127.0.0.1:1087 bun run index.ts
```

Error:

```
TypeError: fetch() URL is invalid
      at node:http:839
```

This error shouldn't have happened. It has been fixed, thanks to [@Hanaasagi](https://github.com/Hanaasagi).
