# Run tests in watch mode with Bun - Bun

Use the `--watch` flag to run your tests in watch mode.

terminal

Copy

```
bun test --watch
```

This will restart the running Bun process whenever a file change is detected. It’s fast. In this example, the editor is configured to save the file on every keystroke.
