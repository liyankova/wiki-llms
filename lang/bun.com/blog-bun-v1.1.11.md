## [Fixed: `bun update` writes to `package.json`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fixed-bun-update-writes-to-package-json)

We fixed a long-standing bug where `bun update` would update dependencies, but only write the changes to the `bun.lockb` and not the `package.json`.

[![](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/assets/709451/53eb658f-d2b4-43c3-8f56-669e23811990)](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/assets/709451/53eb658f-d2b4-43c3-8f56-669e23811990)

To help prevent breaking changes, `bun update` preserves the semver ranges when choosing which dependencies to update. If you want to update to the latest version, use `bun update --latest`.

Thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) for implementing this!

## [Fixed: `bun install` peer dependencies resolution](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fixed-bun-install-peer-dependencies-resolution)

A bug that could cause peer dependencies to be hoisted incorrectly has been fixed, thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway). This bug would frequently reproduce with the `ajv` and `expo` npm packages.

Here's an example of an error this bug could cause:

```
Module build failed (from ./node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js):

```

We've added integrations tests in Bun's repository to prevent this type of bug from occurring again.

## [Fixed: `bun install` no longer relinks workspaces every time](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fixed-bun-install-no-longer-relinks-workspaces-every-time)

A bug in `bun install` led to workspaces being relinked every time, even when they didn't need to be.

Now:

```
bun install
```

```
bun install v1.1.11

Checked 9 installs across 10 packages (no changes) [5.00ms]
```

```
bun install
```

```
bun install v1.1.11

Checked 9 installs across 10 packages (no changes) [5.00ms]
```

Previously:

```
bun-1.1.10 install
```

```
bun install v1.1.10

- work2@workspace:packages/work2
- work3@workspace:packages/work3

2 packages installed [4.00ms]
```

```
bun-1.1.0 install
```

```
bun install v1.1.10

- work2@workspace:packages/work2
- work3@workspace:packages/work3

2 packages installed [4.00ms]
```

Thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) for implementing this!

## [New: 5x faster setTimeout throughput](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#new-5x-faster-settimeout-throughput)

We've re-implemented `setTimeout`, `setImmediate`, and `setInterval` to improve performance, fix bugs and address Node.js compatibility issues.

##### Running `setTimeout` 2,000,000 times on Linux x64

Every call to `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, or `setImmediate` has a cost. In this release, we've reduced the cost of `setTimeout` by 5x on Linux.

| Delta | Runtime | Execution time | Peak RSS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| - | Bun v1.1.11 | 648 ms | 484 MB |
| 5x | Bun v1.1.10 | 3454 ms | 710 MB |
| 1.8x | Node.js 22 | 1182 ms | 487 MB |

[View benchmark](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/blob/main/bench/snippets/set-timeout.mjs)

### [Fixed: setTimeout `this` value is now a `Timeout` object](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fixed-settimeout-this-value-is-now-a-timeout-object)

In Bun, `this` was previously `undefined`. In Node.js, `this` in a `setTimeout` callback is a `Timeout` object. This was a bug, and we've fixed it.

```
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log(this); // Timeout
}, 1000);
```

As before, you can continue to pass `clearTimeout` either the `Timeout` object or the timeout ID.

```
const timer = setTimeout(() => {}, 1000);

// Timeout implements Symbol.toPrimitive, which lets you use it as a number:
const myTimerID = timer[Symbol.toPrimitive]();
const myTimerID2 = timer + 0;

clearTimeout(timer);
clearTimeout(myTimerID);
clearTimeout(myTimerID2);
```

This fix also applies to `setInterval` and `setImmediate`.

### [Fixed: `setInterval` rescheduling behavior matches Node.js](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fixed-setinterval-rescheduling-behavior-matches-node-js)

In Node.js, `setInterval` timers are rescheduled based on when the timer callback was called.

That means if you have a slow synchronous callback, the next interval will be scheduled based on when the callback started, not when it finished.

```
let last = performance.now();
setInterval(function () {
  const now = performance.now();
  console.log("It's been", (now - last) | 0, "ms since the last interval");
  for (let i = 0; i < 1e9; i++) {}
  this.refresh();
  last = performance.now();
}, 500);
```

In Bun v1.1.11 and Node.js v22, this code prints something like:

```
❯ bun set.js # Bun v1.1.11 & Node.js v22
It's been 502 ms since the last interval
It's been 0 ms since the last interval
It's been 231 ms since the last interval
It's been 239 ms since the last interval
It's been 247 ms since the last interval
It's been 244 ms since the last interval
It's been 220 ms since the last interval
It's been 220 ms since the last interval
```

Previously, Bun would print:

```
❯ bun set.js # Bun v1.1.10 and earlier
It's been 502 ms since the last interval
It's been 501 ms since the last interval
It's been 499 ms since the last interval
It's been 501 ms since the last interval
It's been 501 ms since the last interval
It's been 501 ms since the last interval
It's been 501 ms since the last interval
It's been 501 ms since the last interval
```

### [Fixed: `setTimeout` shouldn't await promises](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fixed-settimeout-shouldn-t-await-promises)

Previously, Bun would await promises returned from `setTimeout` and `setInterval`.

This meant the following code would hang:

```
setTimeout(async () => {
  return new Promise();
}, 1000);
```

Bun no longer awaits promises returned from `setTimeout` and `setInterval`.

Thanks to [@zawodskoj](https://github.com/zawodskoj) for fixing this!

## [Node.js compatibility improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#node-js-compatibility-improvements)

This release includes several Node.js compatibility improvements.

### [Fixed: `fs.promises.cp` should create directories on Linux](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fixed-fs-promises-cp-should-create-directories-on-linux)

On Linux, `fs.promises.cp` now creates directories if they don't exist. This matches Node.js behavior, and already worked as expected on Windows and macOS.

Thanks to [@nektro](https://github.com/nektro) for fixing this!

### [Fixed: `node:zlib` brotli parameters](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fixed-node-zlib-brotli-parameters)

A bug in `node:zlib` prevented setting the `params` argument in `zlib.brotliCompress` and `zlib.brotliDecompress`. This has been fixed, thanks to [@nektro](https://github.com/nektro).

### [New: `addAbortListener` and `getMaxListeners` in `node:evenets`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#new-addabortlistener-and-getmaxlisteners-in-node-evenets)

The `addAbortListener` and `getMaxListeners` methods have been implemented in `node:events` (for `EventEmitter`, but not for `EventTarget` yet).

### [Fixed: `path.toNamespacedPath` with backslash edgecase](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fixed-path-tonamespacedpath-with-backslash-edgecase)

An edgecase in `path.toNamespacedPath` has been fixed, thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) and @huseyinacacak-janea. This bug also ocurred in Node.js.

The following assertions now pass:

```
assert.strictEqual(path.win32.toNamespacedPath("\\\\?\\foo\\"), "\\\\?\\foo\\");
assert.strictEqual(path.win32.toNamespacedPath("\\\\?\\foo"), "\\\\?\\foo\\");
assert.strictEqual(
  path.win32.toNamespacedPath("\\\\?\\c:\\Windows/System"),
  "\\\\?\\c:\\Windows\\System",
);
```

### [Fixed: `node:http` server max body size](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fixed-node-http-server-max-body-size)

Node.js doesn't set a max request body size by default. Bun sets a default max request body size, and a bug caused it to also be applied to the `node:http` server's max request body size. This has been fixed, thanks to [@JonnyBurger](https://github.com/JonnyBurger).

## [Fixed: Uncaught exceptions now fail in `bun test`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fixed-uncaught-exceptions-now-fail-in-bun-test)

When an uncaught exception occurs between test cases, Bun makes it more clear that it happened between test cases.

**Breaking change**: The exit code of `bun test` is now 1 when an uncaught exception or unhandled rejection occurs between test cases. This is what it should always have been, and what you'd expect from a test runner.

```
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("uncaught rejection", async () => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    throw new Error("Uh-oh!");
  }, 100);
  await Bun.sleep(99);
});
```

Now this outputs:

```
bun test a.test.ts
```

```
bun test v1.1.11

a.test.ts:
✓ uncaught rejection [100.05ms]

# Unhandled error between tests
-------------------------------
1 | import { test, expect } from "bun:test";
2 |
3 | test("uncaught rejection", async () => {
4 |   setTimeout(() => {
5 |     throw new Error("Uh-oh!");
              ^
error: Uh-oh!
      at a.test.ts:5:11
-------------------------------

 1 pass
 0 fail
 1 error
Ran 1 tests across 1 files. [106.00ms]
```

Previously, this output was less clear. It didn't clearly show the error occurred between test cases and it did not show a count of how many rejection errors occurred.

```
bun-1.1.10 test a.test.ts
```

```
bun test v1.1.10 (5102a944)

a.test.ts:
✓ uncaught rejection [100.32ms]
1 | import { test, expect } from "bun:test";
2 |
3 | test("uncaught rejection", async () => {
4 |   setTimeout(() => {
5 |     throw new Error("Uh-oh!");
              ^
error: Uh-oh!
      at a.test.ts:5:11

 1 pass
 0 fail
Ran 1 tests across 1 files. [111.00ms]
```

## [Fixed: Custom function `name` in stack traces](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fixed-custom-function-name-in-stack-traces)

When you set the `name` property of a function dynamically, Bun now uses that `name` in stack traces.

```
const fn = function OriginalName() {
  console.trace();
};
Object.defineProperty(fn, "name", { value: "NewName" });
fn();
```

In Bun v1.1.11, this code prints:

```
at NewName (abc.js:2:3)
at abc.js:5:1
```

Previously, Bun would print:

```
at OriginalName (abc.js:2:3)
at abc.js:5:1
```

This regressed in Bun v0.6.12 and has been fixed, thanks to [@refi64](https://github.com/refi64). We've added a test to prevent this from happening again.

## [Fixed: Sourcemaps with code splitting](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fixed-sourcemaps-with-code-splitting)

When code splitting is enabled in `bun build`, a bug could cause minified sourcemaps to be invalid in some cases. This has been fixed, thanks to [@paperclover](https://github.com/paperclover).

## [macOS reliability improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#macos-reliability-improvements)

macOS, Linux, and Windows each use different system calls to wait for I/O-related events. On macOS, a bug in our event loop code could cause Bun to wait extra time for I/O events to occur. Previously, we assumed that a [kqueue event](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/System/Conceptual/ManPages_iPhoneOS/man2/kqueue.2.html) would only be either readable or writable:

```
int events = LIBUS_SOCKET_READABLE;
if (kev.flags & EVFILT_WRITE) {
  events = LIBUS_SOCKET_WRITABLE;
}
```

This was incorrect. A kqueue event can be both readable and writable. We've fixed this bug.

### [Fixed: Hang in UDP sockets](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fixed-hang-in-udp-sockets)

Reading from UDP sockets in Bun could hang on macOS x64 and Windows x64. This was caused by an issue in our event loop code. We've fixed this bug.

## [Windows reliability improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#windows-reliability-improvements)

### [Fixed: `Bun.build` CPU usage](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fixed-bun-build-cpu-usage)

A bug causing transpiler threads in `Bun.build` on Windows to spin loop infinitely using CPU has been fixed, thanks to [@paperclover](https://github.com/paperclover).

### [Fixed: External imports with backslashes](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fixed-external-imports-with-backslashes)

On Windows, building the following code with `--external` would fail:

```
bun build --external="*" ./index.js
```

```
import { loadFonts } from "../base";
console.log(loadFonts);
```

Thanks to [@paperclover](https://github.com/paperclover) for fixing this!

### [Fixed: Various DNS issues on Windows](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fixed-various-dns-issues-on-windows)

We've updated the `c-ares` asynchronous DNS resolution library which fixes several bugs on Windows that make it more consistent with Linux and macOS.

## [Fuzz testing](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fuzz-testing)

Fuzz testing parts of Bun's runtime APIs led to several bugfixes in this release.

### [Fixed: Crash when calling Bun.CryptoHasher without `new`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fixed-crash-when-calling-bun-cryptohasher-without-new)

A mistake in Bun's JavasScriptCore bindings generator led to a crash when calling `Bun.CryptoHasher` without `new`. This has been fixed. We've added a test to ensure this doesn't happen again.

### [Fixed: Crash on Linux when reading a Bun.file() errors](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fixed-crash-on-linux-when-reading-a-bun-file-errors)

A crash that could occur when reading a Bun.file() asynchronously errors on Linux has been fixed. This was reported several times and reproduced by a new test.

### [Fixed: Crash in `Bun.$.escape()` without arguments](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fixed-crash-in-bun-escape-without-arguments)

A crash has been fixed when calling `Bun.$.escape()` without arguments. This was reproduced by a new test.

### [Fixed: Crash in `bun:ffi` `read` fn without arguments](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fixed-crash-in-bun-ffi-read-fn-without-arguments)

When calling `read.u32()` in `bun:ffi` without arguments, a crash could occur. This has been fixed.

### [Fixed: Crash in Node.js `Module.prototype._compile`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fixed-crash-in-node-js-module-prototype-compile)

When no arguments or invalid arguments were passed to `Module.prototype._compile`, a crash could occur when an exception was thrown. This has been fixed.

### [Fixed: Crash in `CryptoHasher.byteLength`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.11#fixed-crash-in-cryptohasher-bytelength)

A crash could occur when calling `Bun.CryptoHasher.byteLength` with certain hash algorithms. This has been fixed, thanks to [@nektro](https://github.com/nektro).
