Bun is an incredibly fast JavaScript runtime, bundler, transpiler, and package manager — all in one.

Bun v1.0.32 fixes 13 bugs and improves Node.js compatibility. 'ws' package can now send & receive ping/pong events. util.promisify'd setTimeout setInterval, setImmediate work now. FileHandle methods have been implemented.

## [Fixed: GitHub actions timeout with bun install](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.32#fixed-github-actions-timeout-with-bun-install)

In Bun v1.0.31, we rewrote how a lot of I/O works in Bun in preparation for Windows support. This has led to a few regressions.

When more than 16 lifecycle scripts were invoked at the very end of the install process, `bun install` could potentially hang. To prevent system instability, bun install sets a maximum number of lifecycle scripts to execute concurrently. Due to a bug, the counter which increments the number of active lifecycle scripts was never decremented. This has been fixed.

Thanks to [@farreldarian](https://github.com/farreldarian) for providing an easy reproduction.

## [Fixed: bun install --production regression](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.32#fixed-bun-install-production-regression)

Bun v1.0.31 incorrectly changed the order of how `--frozen-lockfile` and `--production` flags were handled.

These flags are supposed to block installs that change the lockfile, but in v1.0.31, the install process would still occur. The exit code would still be correct (causing CI to fail), but the packages were still installed.

Now it correctly verifies the lockfile and does not install packages when `--frozen-lockfile` is passed before installing packages.

We've expanded our test suite to prevent this from regressing.

## [Fixed: Shell hanging with || &&](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.32#fixed-shell-hanging-with)

In certain cases the following command would hang:

```
import { $ } from "bun";
await $`echo 1 && echo 1`;
```

This was a regression caused by our I/O rewrite. We were not closing a file descriptor. This has been fixed, thanks to [@zackradisic](https://github.com/zackradisic). We have expanded our test suite to prevent this from regressing.

## [Fixed: Using bun shell instead of system shell](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.32#fixed-using-bun-shell-instead-of-system-shell)

In Bun v1.0.31, we unintentionally enabled the bun shell as the package.json script runner for posix. This was only meant to be enabled for Windows. We have written tests to prevent this from happening again.

We've also added the `--shell` flag that lets you opt-in to using either the `"bun"` shell or the `"system"` shell:

```
bun --shell=bun run my-package-json-script
```

## [Fixed: import.meta.url query string parameters](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.32#fixed-import-meta-url-query-string-parameters)

Bun was returning the encoded query string params in `import.meta.url` instead of the decoded query string params.

For the following code:

index.mjs

```
import './test?param=value'
```

test.mjs

```
console.log(import.meta.url);
```

Previously, Bun would return the following incorrect string:

run.sh

```
bun-1.0.31 ./index.mjs
```

```
file:///Users/jarred/test.mjs%3Fparam=value
```

Now Bun returns the correct string:

run.sh

```
bun ./index.mjs
```

```
file:///Users/jarred/test.mjs?param=value
```

Thanks to [@paperclover](https://github.com/paperclover) for fixing this.

## [Fixed: Subprocess.kill(undefined)](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.32#fixed-subprocess-kill-undefined)

The argument-coercion code for Bun.spawn().kill has been tweaked to match the behavior of Node.

Previously, this snippet would hang forever:

```
import { spawn } from "bun";

const proc = spawn({
  cmd: ["sleep", "infinity"],
});
proc.kill(undefined);
```

Now `undefined` will coerce to the equivalent of not passing it any arguments -- `SIGTERM`. Similarly, `null`, `""`, `false` coerce to `SIGTERM`. This aligns the behavior with Node's child\_process.kill and honestly feels more like JavaScript.

## [Node.js compatiblity improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.32#node-js-compatiblity-improvements)

This release also includes a few Node.js compatiblity improvements

### ["ws" module can send & receive `ping` and `pong`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.32#ws-module-can-send-receive-ping-and-pong)

The `"ws"` WebSocket client & server can now send and receive `"ping"` and `"pong"` events when using Bun.

output

ping.mjs

output

```
bun ping.mjs
```

```
Server is listening
Ping received on server side hello
Pong received on client side hello
Pong received on client side hello
```

```
bun-1.0.31 ping.mjs # Before
```

```
Server is listening
Pong received on client side hello
```

```
node ping.mjs # Node, for comparison
```

```
Server is listening
Ping received on server side hello
Pong received on client side hello
Pong received on client side hello
```

ping.mjs

```
import WebSocket, { WebSocketServer } from "ws";

const wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });

wss.on("connection", (ws) => {
  ws.on("ping", (data) => {
    console.log("Ping received on server side", data.toString());
    ws.pong(data);
  });
});

// test client
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080");

ws.on("pong", (data) => {
  console.log("Pong received on client side", data.toString());
});

ws.on("open", () => {
  ws.ping(Buffer.from("hello"));
});

// listen for the server
wss.on("listening", () => {
  console.log("Server is listening");
});
```

### [FileHandle read & write methods](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.32#filehandle-read-write-methods)

The Node `FileHandle` class implementation in Bun is implemented more correctly. You can call `.read` or `.write` and it returns the expected result instead of just a number.

We've also fixed a bug that could cause it to not call `close` on the file descriptor when it should have.

Thanks to [@eventualbuddha](https://github.com/eventualbuddha) for their help with this

### [util.promisify + setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.32#util-promisify-settimeout-setinterval-setimmediate)

When using `util.promisify` on timers in Bun, they now behave like they do in Node.js. This includes:

* `setTimeout`
* `setInterval`
* `setImmediate`

```
import { promisify } from "util";

const setTimeoutAsync = promisify(setTimeout);

await setTimeoutAsync(1000);
// await Bun.sleep(1000)
```

## [Windows support is close](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.32#windows-support-is-close)

We are close to shipping Windows support with Bun v1.1. Once Bun for Windows passes 95% of Bun's test suite, we will announce the release date.

> Bun for Windows currently passes 92.51% of Bun's test suite  
>   
> ████████████░ 92.51%
