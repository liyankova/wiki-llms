Bun v0.5.6 introduces `Bun.sleep`, improves Docker support, and makes various improvements to Node.js and npm compatibility.

```
# Install using curl
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Install using npm
npm install -g bun

# Install using Docker (New!)
docker pull oven/bun:latest

# Upgrade
bun upgrade
```

## [`Bun.sleep`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.6#bun-sleep)

Bun now supports `Bun.sleep()`. This provides a quick and easy API to defer execution without using [`setTimeout()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout).

```
// This:
await Bun.sleep(100);

// Instead of this:
await new Promise((resolve) => {
  setTimeout(resolve, 100);
});
```

You can also specify a [`Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date), which will sleep until the given date.

```
const date = new Date(2024, 01, 01);
await Bun.sleep(date); // sleep until next year
```

## [Docker image: `oven/bun`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.6#docker-image-oven-bun)

Bun has a new and improved Docker image: [`oven/bun`](https://hub.docker.com/r/oven/bun) The base image is Debian and supports both x64 and arm64 architectures.

Here's an example of a [`Dockerfile`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) that uses Bun.

```
FROM oven/bun

ADD src src
ADD package.json package.json
ADD bun.lockb bun.lockb
RUN bun install

CMD bun src/index.js
```

## [Node.js compatibility improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.6#node-js-compatibility-improvements)

* Implemented [`isDeepStrictEqual`](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#utilisdeepstrictequalval1-val2) in `node:util`
* Implemented [`os.cpus()`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#oscpus) on Linux, thanks to [@jwhear](https://github.com/jwhear)
* Fixed [`fs.Dirent`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#class-fsdirent) and [`fs.Stats`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#class-fsstats) not being exported as classes, thanks to [@michalwarda](https://github.com/michalwarda)
* Fixed an issue when importing [`node:perf_hooks`](https://nodejs.org/api/perf_hooks.html) using `require()`
* Fixed an issue when importing WebCrypto from [`node:crypto`](https://nodejs.org/api/webcrypto.html)

## [`bun install` improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.6#bun-install-improvements)

* Fixed issues when hoisting [`peerDependencies`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#peerdependencies)
* Fixed binaries not being linked when the package was in a workspace
* Fixed an issue where `bun install` would download the last modified tag, instead of the latest tag
* Fixed an issue when installing packages with the `npm:` prefix
* Changed workspaces to not resolve recursively (matches what `npm` does)

Thanks to [@alexlamsl](https://github.com/alexlamsl) fixing these issues!
