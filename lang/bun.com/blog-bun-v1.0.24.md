Bun is an incredibly fast JavaScript runtime, bundler, transpiler, and package manager — all in one. In case you missed it, here are some of the recent changes to Bun.

This release fixes 9 bugs and adds Bun Shell, a fast cross-platform shell with seamless JavaScript interop. Fixes a socket timeout bug, a potential crash when socket closes, a Node.js compatibility issue with Hapi, a process.exit bug, and bun install binlinking bug, bun inspect regression, and bun:test expect().toContain bug.

## [Bun Shell](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.24#bun-shell)

The Bun Shell is an experimental embedded language & interpreter in Bun that allows you to run cross-platform shell scripts in JavaScript & TypeScript.

```
import { $, file } from "bun";

const resp = await fetch("https://example.com");

const stdout = await $`gzip -c < ${resp}`.arrayBuffer();

// as a file()
await $`ls *.js > ${file("output.txt")}`;

// or as a file path string, if you prefer:
await $`ls *.js > output.txt`;
await $`ls *.js > ${"output.txt"}`;

// Get the output as text
const combined = await $`cat ./1.txt ./2.txt`.text();

// iterate over the output line-by-line
for await (let line of $`cat ./1.txt ./2.txt`.lines()) {
  console.log(line);
}
```

## [Fixed: socket timeout behavior](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.24#fixed-socket-timeout-behavior)

In Node.js, when a `net.Socket` times out, it emits a `timeout` event. In Bun, we emitted the `timeout` event, but we also closed the socket. This is not the behavior of Node.js and is not what users expect, so we fixed it. This also applies to `Bun.connect()` and `Bun.listen()`.

## [Fixed: Potential crash when socket closes](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.24#fixed-potential-crash-when-socket-closes)

A crash that could occur when frequently connecting and disconnecting from sockets (usually a database client) has been fixed

## [Node.js compatiblity improvements for `"perf_hooks"`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.24#node-js-compatiblity-improvements-for-perf-hooks)

Previously, Hapi (`@hapi/hapi`) was not working in Bun because the `perf_hooks.eventLoopUtilization` function was not defined. Bun now defines it, and returns empty values for all metrics which unblocks Hapi.

## [Fixed: process.exit threw "exitCode is not a number" in some cases](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.24#fixed-process-exit-threw-exitcode-is-not-a-number-in-some-cases)

`process.exit(eval("1.234 - 0.234"))` would throw an error in Bun, but not in Node.js. This has been fixed.

The bug was in how Bun was reading the `exitCode` argument within the `process.exit` function. JavaScriptCore's JSValue representation of `1.234 - 0.234` represents it as a 64-bit floating point number, even though it is technically just the signed 32-bit integer `1`. Bun's code was specifically checking if the representation was a signed 32 bit integer instead of being any integer number, which caused the error. The fix was to check if the value was an integer number instead of a signed 32-bit integer.

This bug impacted Prisma CLI, which uses `process.exit` to exit the process with a non-zero exit code when an error occurs.

## [Fixed: bin linking in bun install with dangling symlinks](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.24#fixed-bin-linking-in-bun-install-with-dangling-symlinks)

When a symlink already existed but pointed to a path which no longer exited, `bun install` would not overwrite the symlink. This has been fixed, thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway).

## [Fixed: regression with fully-qualified URL in `bun --inspect`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.24#fixed-regression-with-fully-qualified-url-in-bun-inspect)

When using `bun --inspect` with a fully-qualified URL, the URL was not being parsed correctly. This has been fixed, thanks to [@Electroid](https://github.com/Electroid).

A bug where `bun:test`'s implementation of `expect(a).toContain("")` behaved inconsistently with Jest has been fixed, thanks to [@DontBreakAlex](https://github.com/DontBreakAlex).

## [Fixed: path.parse edgecase](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.24#fixed-path-parse-edgecase)

Given the string `path.parse('.prettierrc')`, the `path.parse` function in Bun would return different results in Bun and Node.js.

Now Bun returns the same result as in Node.js, thanks to [@Aarav-Juneja](https://github.com/Aarav-Juneja).

## [Fixed: hang in recursive console.log](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.24#fixed-hang-in-recursive-console-log)

A hang when a function logs inside of console.\* has been fixed, thanks to [@LukasKastern](https://github.com/LukasKastern).
