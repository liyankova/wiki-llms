# 500x faster postMessage(string)

[`postMessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) is the most common way to send data between multiple worker threads in JavaScript, and in Bun v1.2.21, `postMessage(string)` performance is nearly independent of string size. This is a big improvement for multi-threaded JavaScript servers & CLIs.

[![Bun postMessage vs Node.js postMessage](https://bun.com/images/bun-postmessage-node.png)](https://bun.com/images/bun-postmessage-node.png)

By avoiding serialization for strings we know are safe to share across threads, it's **up to 500x faster** and uses **~22x less peak memory** in [this benchmark](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/blob/b1417f494d389f4c75c21cfc6303d2a7a08a66d1/bench/postMessage/postMessage-string.mjs).

| String Size | Bun 1.2.21 | Bun 1.2.20 | Node 24.6.0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 11 chars | 543 ns | 598 ns | 806 ns |
| 14 KB | 460 ns | 1,350 ns | 1,220 ns |
| 3 MB | 593 ns | 326,290 ns | 242,110 ns |

The optimization kicks in automatically when you send strings between workers:

```
// Common pattern: sending JSON between workers
const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
const json = await response.text();
postMessage(json); // Now 500x faster for large strings
```

This is particularly useful for applications that pass large JSON payloads between workers, like API servers, data processing pipelines, and real-time applications.

## [How we did this in JavaScriptCore](https://bun.com/blog/how-we-made-postMessage-string-500x-faster#how-we-did-this-in-javascriptcore)

*Want to know the technical details? Keep reading for a deep dive into how we optimized string handling in WebKit's JavaScript engine.*

### [The key insight](https://bun.com/blog/how-we-made-postMessage-string-500x-faster#the-key-insight)

[`postMessage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) typically uses the [Structured Clone Algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm) to serialize data before sending it to another thread. This means copying every byte of your string into a new buffer, then deserializing it on the other side.

But here's the thing: in JavaScriptCore (the engine Bun uses), strings are already thread-safe reference-counted objects. The string data itself is immutable after creation, and the reference count uses `std::atomic`:

wtf/text/StringImpl.h

```
class StringImplShape {
    std::atomic<unsigned> m_refCount;  // Thread-safe!
    unsigned m_length;                  // Immutable
    union {
        const LChar* m_data8;           // Immutable
        const char16_t* m_data16;       // Immutable
    };
    mutable unsigned m_hashAndFlags;    // The only mutable part
};
```

So if strings are already thread-safe, why serialize them at all when sending between threads in the same process?

### [Finding the fast path](https://bun.com/blog/how-we-made-postMessage-string-500x-faster#finding-the-fast-path)

Not all strings can be safely shared. We identified three types that need serialization:

1. **Atom strings** - Thread-local property names and symbols
2. **Substrings** - Point to other strings with complex lifetimes
3. **Rope strings** - Created by operations like `"foo" + "bar"` or `.slice()`

For everything else, we can skip serialization entirely. We just need to ensure the lazily-computed hash value is calculated before sharing (since that's the only mutable part):

```
WTF::String toCrossThreadShareable(WTF::String& string)
{
    auto* impl = string.impl();

    // Can't share atoms, symbols, or substrings
    if (impl->isAtom() || impl->isSymbol() ||
        impl->bufferOwnership() == StringImpl::BufferSubstring)
        return string.isolatedCopy();

    // Force hash computation before sharing
    impl->hash();

    // Prevent this thread from atomizing.
    impl->setNeverAtomicize();

    return string;  // Share the pointer directly!
}
```

### [The fast path conditions](https://bun.com/blog/how-we-made-postMessage-string-500x-faster#the-fast-path-conditions)

The optimization applies when:

* You're using `postMessage` or `structuredClone`
* You're sending only a string (not mixed data)
* The string isn't a substring, rope, atom, or symbol
* You're sending to another thread in the same process
* The string.length >= 256 characters

This covers the extremely common pattern of sending strings between workers, which is why the performance improvement is so dramatic.

### [What's next](https://bun.com/blog/how-we-made-postMessage-string-500x-faster#what-s-next)

We could expand this optimization to include string values within objects and arrays, but a 500x speedup for one of the most common worker communication patterns is a great start. The same approach could potentially apply to other immutable data types in the future.
