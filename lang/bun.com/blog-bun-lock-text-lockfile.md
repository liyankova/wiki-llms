# Bun's new text-based lockfile

---

[Jarred Sumner](https://twitter.com/jarredsumner) · December 17, 2024

`bun install` is a fast npm-compatible package manager you can use with Node.js or Bun.

The most common piece of feedback teams migrating from npm, pnpm, or yarn to `bun install` share is about Bun's `bun.lockb` binary lockfile format. Binary lockfiles are tricky to review in pull requests. Merge conflicts get harder to resolve. Tooling can't easily read a binary lockfile.

To help with that, we previously added support for `bun ./bun.lockb` to generate a `yarn.lock`-compatible lockfile, but this wasn't enough. The source of truth was still the binary lockfile. You had to run `bun` on the binary lockfile in order to get the yarn's lockfile. This doesn't work well with Github, with tools or with merge conflicts.

That's why in Bun v1.1.39, we're introducing a `bun.lock` - a new text-based lockfile format for `bun install`:

```
bun install --save-text-lockfile
```

Instead of saving the binary `bun.lockb` file, this flag makes Bun save a text-based `bun.lock` file. In Bun v1.2, we're planning to make this the default.

bun.lock

```
{
  "lockfileVersion": 0,
  "workspaces": {
    "": {
      "dependencies": {
        "uWebSocket.js": "uNetworking/uWebSockets.js#v20.51.0",
      },
    },
  },
  "packages": {
    "uWebSocket.js": ["uWebSockets.js@github:uNetworking/uWebSockets.js#6609a88", {}, "uNetworking-uWebSockets.js-6609a88"],
  }
}
```

If a `bun.lockb` file or `package-lock.json` file exists the first time you run `bun install --save-text-lockfile`, bun will use the existing lockfile to generate the `bun.lock` file, preserving resolutions and metadata.

## [Cached `bun install` gets 30% faster](https://bun.com/blog/bun-lock-text-lockfile#cached-bun-install-gets-30-faster)

**Some projects start out being faster than alternatives, and then get slower as they add missing features and fix bugs. Bun is *not* one of those projects**. We don't accept performance regressions.

In Bun v1.1.39, we made cached `bun install` using the text lockfile 30% faster compared to cached `bun install` with the binary lockfile in Bun v1.1.38.

### [What makes bun install fast?](https://bun.com/blog/bun-lock-text-lockfile#what-makes-bun-install-fast)

`bun install` is fast because we try really hard to make it fast. There's no "one thing" like a binary lockfile format that makes it fast.

#### Structure of Arrays

We do a lot of work to avoid O(N^3) memory allocations. When you have many dependent and nested objects/structs to serialize (such as packages, their dependencies, their dependencies' dependencies, and the resolutions), how do you avoid allocating each object/struct separately? You use indices into linearly-serializable arrays instead of pointers/objects.

In TypeScript, the slow but relatively common approach to storing packages in a package manager would look something like this:

slow.ts

```
interface SlowPackage {
  name: string;
  version: string;
  dependencies: Record<string, Dependency>;

  /// ... more fields ...
}

interface Workspace {
  packages: Record<string, Package>;
  root: Package;
}
```

The fast (and overly simplified) version would look something like this:

fast.ts

```
interface Package {
  /** Index into strings array */
  name: number;
  /** Index into strings array */
  version: number;
  /** Index into dependencies array */
  dependenciesStart: number;
  /** Length of dependencies array */
  dependenciesCount: number;
  /** Start offset into resolutions array */
  resolutionsStart: number;
  /** Length of resolutions array */
  resolutionsCount: number;
}

interface Workspace {
  packages: Package[];
  dependencies: Dependency[];
  resolutions: number[];
  strings: string[];
}
```

Instead of arrays for each element inside of an array, we use one big array for each type and append to it. This is usually called a [Structure of Arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA).

#### Small string optimizations

When you have lots of usually-tiny strings (such as package names or versions), instead of allocating each string separately, you could store tiny strings in the same space used to reference them. In higher-level languages like JavaScript, strings are abstracted away from you, but in Zig, C++, or Rust, ["small string optimizations"](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20230803-00/?p=108532) are [well-known](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/small-strings-in-rust).

In Zig, our `semver.String` struct optimizes for small strings:

```
pub const String = extern struct {
    pub const max_inline_len: usize = 8;
    /// This is three different types of string.
    /// 1. Empty string. If it's all zeroes, then it's an empty string.
    /// 2. If the final bit is set, then it's a string that is stored inline.
    /// 3. If the final bit is not set, then it's a string that is stored in an external buffer.
    bytes: [max_inline_len]u8 = [8]u8{ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
};
```

#### Careful I/O

We pay close attention to what system calls are used. We avoid opening directories and reading files unless we need to. We use extremely specific, sometimes uncommon platform-specific system calls like `clonefile`, `sendfile`, `faccessat`, `memfd_create`, etc to avoid unnecessary work.

I could rant for a really long time about all the optimizations we make in `bun install`, but you get the idea. It was never the binary lockfile format. We just try really hard to make it fast, and all that work applies to the text-based lockfile format too.

## [Not a breaking change](https://bun.com/blog/bun-lock-text-lockfile#not-a-breaking-change)

We're planning to make `bun.lock` the default in Bun v1.2.0. In the meantime, we continue to support the binary `bun.lockb` format and will do so for awhile.

Until Bun v1.2, the `bun install --save-text-lockfile` flag will be required to generate the text-based lockfile. When a `bun.lock` file exists, `bun install` will use the text-based lockfile and ignore the binary lockfile. Otherwise, it will generate the binary lockfile.

## [Tooling compatibility](https://bun.com/blog/bun-lock-text-lockfile#tooling-compatibility)

The `bun.lock` file is JSONC (like tsconfig.json)

### [Visual Studio Code](https://bun.com/blog/bun-lock-text-lockfile#visual-studio-code)

VSCode will syntax highlight the `bun.lock` file for you, thanks to [@remcohaszing](https://github.com/remcohaszing).

### [GitHub & git](https://bun.com/blog/bun-lock-text-lockfile#github-git)

GitHub renders `bun.lock` in diffs, which is important when reviewing code.

Previously, GitHub didn't render the binary `bun.lockb` file.

At the time of writing, Dependabot's [#1 most upvoted feature request](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/6528) is to support `bun`. A text-based lockfile makes this a lot easier for the Dependabot team to add support for.
