# Bun v0.5.2

---

[Jarred Sumner](https://twitter.com/jarredsumner) · January 31, 2023

We're hiring [C/C++ and Zig engineers](https://bun.com/careers) to build the future of JavaScript!

Bun v0.5.2 adds support for `github:` dependencies in `bun install` and fixes several bugs in `bun install`. `Buffer` is faster and passes more Node.js tests. `bun run` now supports executing WebAssembly binaries, including WASI support. WebAssembly performance has improved thanks to JavaScriptCore and work from @Constellation. The remaining `node:dns` resolve functions are implemented. The `body-parser` package from Express works in Bun. MongoDB works in Bun.

```
# Install Bun
curl https://bun.sh/install | bash

# Upgrade to latest release of Bun
bun upgrade
```

You can install bun with npm (thanks to [@Electroid](https://github.com/Electroid)):

```
npm install -g bun
```

## [GitHub dependencies](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.2#github-dependencies)

`bun install` now supports adding GitHub repositories as a dependency using the `github:` prefix.

`package.json`:

```
{
  "name": "zoddy",
  "dependencies": {
    "zod": "github:colinhacks/zod"
  }
}
```

`index.ts`:

```
import { z } from "zod";
console.log(z.string().parse("hello"));
```

Output:

```
❯ bun index.ts
{ success: true, error: undefined, value: 'hello' }
```

This is also supported by `npm`, `yarn`, and other package managers.

## [More stability for `bun install`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.2#more-stability-for-bun-install)

This release includes a few important bug fixes that make `bun install` more stable. Thanks to [@alexlamsl](https://github.com/alexlamsl) for fixing these issues!

* Bun would sometimes show "failed to resolve" errors when installing packages with unusual combinations of build/pre tags due to a bug in the semver comparison code. https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/1854
* `bun link` failed with scoped packages, e.g. `@scope/name`. https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/1892
* `bun install <package>` didn't handle `file://` or `link://` prefixes correctly. https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/1895
* `npm:` aliases, which were introduced in v0.5.1, had some edge-cases that were not correctly handled. https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/1927
* Certain edge-cases would cause a segfault when installing a package, and have been fixed.

## [MongoDB support](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.2#mongodb-support)

MongoDB now works in Bun, thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari). You can now use Bun to build web applications with MongoDB.

```
import { MongoClient } from "mongodb";

const client = new MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017");
await client.connect();
const db = client.db("test");
const collection = db.collection("test");
await collection.insertOne({ hello: "world" });
const result = await collection.findOne({ hello: "world" });

console.log(result);
// { _id: 60a7b5b0b9c3b8b5b8b5b9c3, hello: 'world' }
```

## [Support for `body-parser`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.2#support-for-body-parser)

The `body-parser` package for Express now works in Bun. Previously, this package would throw an error due to a bug in Bun's `StringDecoder` implementation.

```
import express from "express";
import bodyParser from "body-parser";

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World!");
});

app.post("/echo", (req, res) => {
  res.send(req.body);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Example app listening at http://localhost:3000");
});
```

Output:

```
curl -X POST -d '{"hello":"world"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:3000/echo
{"hello":"world"}
```

## [Run WebAssembly files with `bun run`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.2#run-webassembly-files-with-bun-run)

`bun run` now supports executing WebAssembly binaries, and also includes WASI support.

```
❯ bun run hello.wasm
"Hello, World!"
```

Bun also supports the [`node:wasi`](https://nodejs.org/api/wasi.html#webassembly-system-interface-wasi) module. Bun's implementation is based on great work from [wasi-js](https://github.com/sagemathinc/cowasm/tree/main/packages/wasi-js#wasi-js) by [@williamstein](https://github.com/williamstein), which is a fork of [wasmer-js](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-js) by the @wasmerio team, which is a fork of [node-wasi](https://github.com/devsnek/node-wasi) by [@devsnek](https://github.com/devsnek).

## [Faster and more compliant `Buffer`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.2#faster-and-more-compliant-buffer)

`Buffer.from()` is up to 2x faster with typed arrays.

Before:

```
cpu: Apple M1 Max
runtime: bun 0.5.1 (arm64-darwin)

Buffer.from(ArrayBuffer(100))                   76.48 ns/iter  (68.83 ns … 375.76 ns)  73.46 ns 247.37 ns 262.24 ns
Buffer.from(Uint8Array(100))                    54.28 ns/iter  (49.57 ns … 192.52 ns)  52.21 ns 107.67 ns 118.02 ns
Buffer.from(Uint8Array(0))                      51.29 ns/iter  (48.58 ns … 127.98 ns)  50.54 ns  95.97 ns 109.26 ns
```

After:

```
cpu: Apple M1 Max
runtime: bun 0.5.2 (arm64-darwin)

Buffer.from(ArrayBuffer(100))                   33.91 ns/iter  (27.52 ns … 343.25 ns)  31.03 ns 203.33 ns 219.75 ns
Buffer.from(Uint8Array(100))                    31.67 ns/iter  (28.72 ns … 103.17 ns)  30.07 ns  78.78 ns  82.05 ns
Buffer.from(Uint8Array(0))                      27.88 ns/iter  (25.95 ns … 185.95 ns)  27.24 ns  67.63 ns  77.94 ns
```

The Node.js tests for `Buffer.write()` and `Buffer.byteLength` also now pass. We've added the deprecated `parent` and `offset` properties, along with several bug fixes. Compatibility isn't 100% there yet, but it's getting much closer.

We've also fixed a bug where Bun would erroneously report "invalid encoding" that occurred in Bun v0.5.1.

## [More `node:dns` support](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.2#more-node-dns-support)

`node:dns` now supports more methods, thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari).

```
import dns from "node:dns";

dns.resolveCname("example.com");
// ...
// dns.resolveMx();
// dns.resolveNs();
// dns.resolveTxt();
// dns.resolveSrv();
// dns.resolvePtr();
// dns.resolveSoa();
```

## [Node.js compatibility fixes](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.2#node-js-compatibility-fixes)

* Bun supports `process.execArgv` and `process.argv0` which is used by many packages, including Vite.
* A slow `node:zlib` polyfill has been added. We will add a faster implementation in the future.
* A bug causing the `this` value in `EventEmitter` callbacks to be `undefined` has been fixed.
* Node-API's `napi_create_symbol` didn't handle symbol descriptions properly, which is now fixed. https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/commit/aa456805ddc9fd44152d73888ecb8733b60f34b9
* Node-API's `napi_define_properties` implementation didn't support symbols, which is now fixed. https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/commit/4570ff77807a334f7bcd23e4b69b758d365b82a0
* `node:http`'s `address()` function was missing and the `onListen` callback wasn't handling every case. https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/commit/befd97a891d7de50ae130cdf262b2bf6d5ac69bc
* A bug in `fs.stat()` with non-ascii paths has also been fixed. https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/1887

## [Bug fixes](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.2#bug-fixes)

* `bun --hot`'s filesystem watcher previously didn't work reliably on Linux or when text editors saved with swapfiles or atomic files. This has been fixed. It also didn't report exceptions when hot reloaded modules threw exceptions. This has been fixed as well. https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/commit/421588d63119fb15cd4db06838bb7058d72cc727
* Bun's `WebSocket` client sometimes caused a hang. Thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) for fixing this. https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/1910
* Bun's `WebSocket` client didn't work when the body size exceeded 65536 bytes. Thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari) for fixing this. https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/1909
* Query string parameters can now be used in import specifiers which will invalidate the module resolution cache for that folder.
* Using nginx as a reverse proxy to Bun previously required specifying `proxy_http_version 1.1` in the nginx config. Now it works with `proxy_http_version 1.0` as well, which is the default. Thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari) for investigating and fixing.
* A SQLite client bug that affected complex queries using `query.get()` or `query.run()` has been fixed. https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/1366
* A TypeScript transpiler bug with constructor property accessors has been fixed. https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/1883
* A TypeScript transpiler bug with declare inside classes has been fixed.

[#### Bun v0.5.1](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.1)
