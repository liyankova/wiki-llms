## [Async Stack Traces](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#async-stack-traces)

Bun's stack traces now include asynchronous call frames, making it significantly easier to debug code using `async`/`await`. Previously, these frames were omitted, leading to incomplete stack traces. Now, you'll see the full asynchronous execution path leading to an error.

async.js

```
async function foo() {
  return await bar();
}

async function bar() {
  return await baz();
}

async function baz() {
  await 1; // ensure it's a real async function
  throw new Error("oops");
}

try {
  await foo();
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
}
```

This now outputs:

```
❯ bun async.js
 6 |   return await baz();
 7 | }
 8 |
 9 | async function baz() {
10 |   await 1; // ensure it's a real async function
11 |   throw new Error("oops");
                 ^
error: oops
      at baz (async.js:11:13)
      at async bar (async.js:6:16)
      at async foo (async.js:2:16)
```

Previously, it would output:

```
❯ bun-1.2.21 async.js
 6 |   return await baz();
 7 | }
 8 |
 9 | async function baz() {
10 |   await 1; // ensure it's a real async function
11 |   throw new Error("oops");
             ^
error: oops
      at baz (async.js:11:9)
```

Additionally, a bug that could cause stack traces printed to the console to be missing frames after accessing `error.stack` has been fixed.

And a bug with the error stack for Error subclases has been fixed.

Huge thanks to @sosukesuzuki for implementing this in JavaScriptCore!

## [240x faster `postMessage` and `structuredClone` for simple objects](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#240x-faster-postmessage-and-structuredclone-for-simple-objects)

A new fast path has been added for `postMessage` and `structuredClone` when dealing with "simple" objects. This optimization applies to plain JavaScript objects that contain only primitive values like strings, numbers, booleans, `null`, and `undefined`.

## [Support for interactive TTYs after `stdin` closes](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#support-for-interactive-ttys-after-stdin-closes)

A common pattern for TUI (Terminal User Interface) applications is to first process data piped from `stdin`, and then open `/dev/tty` to start an interactive session. This pattern was previously broken in Bun, causing an `ESPIPE` error when reading from the TTY stream.

This has been fixed by correctly handling file streams for character devices. Additionally, `tty.ReadStream` now supports `.ref()` and `.unref()` for parity with Node.js, allowing for better control over the event loop in TUI applications. This resolves a long-standing bug affecting many interactive CLI tools.

script.js

```
import { createReadStream } from "fs";
import { stdin, stdout } from "process";

// 1. Process any data piped from stdin
for await (const chunk of stdin) {
  stdout.write(`Piped data: ${chunk}`);
}

// 2. After stdin closes, open /dev/tty for interactive input
stdout.write(
  "stdin closed. Now accepting interactive input (type 'exit' to quit):\n"
);
const tty = createReadStream("/dev/tty");

for await (const chunk of tty) {
  const line = chunk.toString().trim();
  stdout.write(`You typed: "${line}"\n`);
  if (line === "exit") {
    tty.destroy();
  }
}
```

To run:

```
echo "Initial data" | bun script.js
```

## [Bun.SQL improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#bun-sql-improvements)

### [MySQL Adapter](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#mysql-adapter)

In Bun v1.2.21, we introduced MySQL & SQLite adapters for `Bun.SQL`. This release includes several improvements to the MySQL adapter.

#### `affectedRows` and `lastInsertRowid`

`affectedRows` and `lastInsertRowid` properties are now returned by the MySQL driver. `affectedRows` contains the number of rows changed by the query, and `lastInsertRowid` contains the ID of the last inserted row. This brings the MySQL driver's API closer to `Bun.SQL`.

```
import { sql } from "bun";

// For INSERT queries
const insertResult = await sql`INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('John Doe');`;
console.log(insertResult.lastInsertRowid); // e.g., 1
console.log(insertResult.affectedRows); // 1

// For UPDATE queries
const updateResult =
  await sql`UPDATE users SET name = 'Jane Doe' WHERE id = 1;`;
console.log(updateResult.affectedRows); // 1
```

#### Better column type handling

Thanks to community feedback, we've made the following improvements to MySQL driver's column type handling:

| MySQL Type | JavaScript Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| INT, TINYINT, MEDIUMINT | number | Within safe integer range |
| BIT(1) | boolean |  |

Previously:

* `TINYINT` columns were incorrectly parsed as booleans instead of numbers.
* `BIT(1)` columns were incorrectly parsed as numbers instead of booleans.
* `BIT(N)` columns (where N > 1) were incorrectly parsed as `Buffer`s instead of numbers, but only when the binary protocol was used.

#### TLS Support

`Bun.SQL` now supports connecting to MySQL databases over a TLS/SSL connection. This is done by passing a `tls` option to the `Bun.SQL` constructor, matching the behavior of the PostgreSQL adapter and other Bun APIs.

#### `mysql_native_password` authentication

`Bun.SQL` now correctly handles `mysql_native_password` authentication and authentication switching, improving compatibility with a wider range of MySQL servers.

### [PostgreSQL improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#postgresql-improvements)

* Fixed: A bug in `Bun.SQL`'s Postgres driver where an error in a pipelined query could cause the connection to disconnect.
* Fixed: In certain cases, Bun.SQL could resolve a PostgreSQL query's Promise before the server reported being ready.
* Fixed: Bun.SQL now correctly decodes `TIME` and `TIMETZ` columns from PostgreSQL when using the binary protocol.

## [Bundler & minifier](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#bundler-minifier)

> In the next version of Bun

### [Minifier optimizes `new` expressions for smaller bundles](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#minifier-optimizes-new-expressions-for-smaller-bundles)

Bun's JavaScript minifier now implements several new optimizations for built-in constructors, resulting in smaller bundle sizes.

When constructing built-in objects like `Object`, `Array`, or `Error`, the `new` keyword is often optional and has no effect on the runtime behavior. Bun now automatically removes the `new` keyword or replaces the entire expression with a more compact literal form, such as converting `new Object()` to `{}`.

This optimization applies to `new Object()`, `new Array()`, `new Error()` (and its subtypes), and `new Function()`.

javascript

```
-const obj=new Object();
+const obj={};
-const arr=new Array(1, 2, 3);
+const arr=[1,2,3];
-const err=new Error("Something went wrong");
+const err=Error("Something went wrong");
```

Thanks to @dylan-conway for the contribution

### [`typeof undefined` checks are now minified](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#typeof-undefined-checks-are-now-minified)

Bun's minifier now optimizes `typeof` checks for `"undefined"`. This common optimization, also used by tools like esbuild, reduces bundle size by replacing string comparisons with shorter character comparisons. This change also improves dead code elimination for code guarded by these checks.

```
// Input
console.log(typeof x === "undefined");
console.log(typeof x !== "undefined");

// Minified output
console.log(typeof x > "u");
console.log(typeof x < "u");
```

Thanks to @Jarred-Sumner and @dylan-conway for this change

### [`onEnd` hook for bundler plugins](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#onend-hook-for-bundler-plugins)

`Bun.build` now supports the `onEnd` hook in plugins, aligning its plugin API closer to esbuild. This hook is triggered after a build is complete—whether it succeeds or fails—and provides access to the `BuildOutput` object. This is useful for post-processing, cleanup, or sending notifications.

```
await Bun.build({
  entrypoints: ["./index.ts"],
  outdir: "./out",
  plugins: [
    {
      name: "onEnd example",
      setup(build) {
        build.onEnd((result) => {
          if (result.success) {
            console.log(
              `✅ Build succeeded with ${result.outputs.length} outputs`,
            );
          } else {
            console.error(`❌ Build failed with ${result.logs.length} errors`);
          }
        });
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

Thanks to @alii for the contribution

### [`jsxSideEffects` option](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#jsxsideeffects-option)

By default, Bun's bundler treats JSX as "pure", meaning it can be removed if its return value is unused. This process, known as dead code elimination, can cause problems when a component has side effects that need to be preserved.

A new option, `jsxSideEffects`, has been introduced to prevent this. When set to `true`, Bun will no longer mark JSX as pure, ensuring that components with side effects are always included in the final bundle.

You can enable this feature in your `tsconfig.json` or by using a command-line flag.

```
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsxSideEffects": true
  }
}
```

This ensures that code with side effects, like the example below, behaves as expected.

```
// component.jsx
let counter = 0;
function MyComponent() {
  counter++; // This side effect will now be preserved
  return <div>Hello</div>;
}

// index.jsx
<MyComponent />;
console.log(counter); // Reliably logs 1
```

### [Unused function and class names are now removed during minification](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#unused-function-and-class-names-are-now-removed-during-minification)

Bun's bundler now removes unused function and class expression names when minifying (`--minify-syntax`). This matches esbuild's behavior and results in smaller bundle sizes.

A new `--keep-names` flag has been added to preserve these names, which can be useful for debugging or for libraries that rely on `Function.prototype.name`.

```
// input.js
const myFunc = function myInternalName() {
  // "myInternalName" is not used anywhere
};

const myClass = class MyInternalClass {
  // "MyInternalClass" is not used anywhere
};

// After `bun build --minify ./input.js`:
//
// const myFunc = function() {};
// const myClass = class {};

// To preserve the names, use `bun build --minify --keep-names`
// or `keepNames: true` in your build configuration.
```

Thanks to @dylan-conway for the contribution

## [Monitor event loop delay with `perf_hooks.monitorEventLoopDelay()`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#monitor-event-loop-delay-with-perf-hooks-monitoreventloopdelay)

Bun now implements the `perf_hooks.monitorEventLoopDelay()` API for Node.js compatibility. This function creates and returns an `IntervalHistogram` object that samples the event loop delay in nanoseconds. You can use it to diagnose performance issues and understand your application's responsiveness.

```
import { monitorEventLoopDelay } from "perf_hooks";

const histogram = monitorEventLoopDelay({ resolution: 20 });
histogram.enable();

// Introduce a delay
await Bun.sleep(100);

histogram.disable();

console.log("Event Loop Delay (ns):");
console.log("Min:", histogram.min);
console.log("Max:", histogram.max);
console.log("Mean:", histogram.mean);
console.log("50th Percentile:", histogram.percentile(50));
console.log("99th Percentile:", histogram.percentile(99));

// Reset for next measurement
histogram.reset();
```

## [`http.Server.prototype.closeIdleConnections()` is now implemented](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#http-server-prototype-closeidleconnections-is-now-implemented)

The `server.closeIdleConnections()` method from Node.js's `http` module is now implemented. This method immediately closes all sockets that are not currently handling a request, which is useful for gracefully shutting down an HTTP server without waiting for idle keep-alive connections to time out.

```
import { createServer } from "http";

const server = createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end("Hello, World!");
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server listening on port 3000");

  // On a shutdown signal (e.g. SIGINT)
  process.on("SIGINT", () => {
    console.log("Closing server...");

    // Stop accepting new connections
    server.close((err) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error(err);
        process.exit(1);
      }
      console.log("Server closed.");
    });

    // Forcefully close any idle keep-alive connections
    // This allows the server.close() callback to fire sooner.
    server.closeIdleConnections();
  });
});
```

Bun's `WebSocket` client now correctly implements subprotocol negotiation as specified in RFC 6455. When you instantiate a `new WebSocket()` with an array of desired subprotocols, Bun will send them in the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header.

The server can then select one of these protocols to use for the connection. Bun correctly validates the server's choice and makes the selected protocol available on the `ws.protocol` property. If the server responds with an invalid protocol, or doesn't select a protocol when one is required, the connection is now correctly rejected.

This fixes a long-standing compatibility issue with popular libraries like `ws` and `obs-websocket-js`.

```
// server (which already worked fine):
Bun.serve({
  port: 3000,
  fetch(req, server) {
    // Client is requesting "chat" and "superchat" protocols.
    // We'll select "chat".
    const success = server.upgrade(req, {
      headers: {
        "Sec-WebSocket-Protocol": "chat",
      },
    });
    return success
      ? undefined
      : new Response("Upgrade failed", { status: 500 });
  },
  websocket: {
    open(ws) {
      console.log(`Server: new connection with protocol "${ws.protocol}"`);
    },
  },
});

// Client code:
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:3000", ["chat", "superchat"]);

ws.onopen = () => {
  // `ws.protocol` is now correctly set to the protocol
  // selected by the server.
  // Before, this would be an empty string.
  console.log(`Client: connected with protocol "${ws.protocol}"`); // "chat"
  ws.close();
};
```

### [Override `Host` and other headers in `new WebSocket()`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#override-host-and-other-headers-in-new-websocket)

You can now override special WebSocket headers like `Host`, `Sec-WebSocket-Key`, and `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` when creating a new client-side `WebSocket` connection. This is done by passing a `headers` object to the `WebSocket` constructor.

This is useful for advanced use-cases like connecting through proxies that require a specific `Host` header, testing servers with specific keys, or implementing custom subprotocol negotiation. Bun will automatically handle generating required WebSocket headers if they are not provided.

```
// Bun now supports overriding special headers in the WebSocket client
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080", {
  headers: {
    "Host": "custom-host.example.com",
    "Sec-WebSocket-Key": "dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==", // Must be a valid base64-encoded 16-byte key
    "Sec-WebSocket-Protocol": "chat, superchat",

    // This already worked:
    "X-Custom-Header": "MyValue",
  },
});
```

## [Connect to specific Redis databases with `Bun.RedisClient`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#connect-to-specific-redis-databases-with-bun-redisclient)

Bun's built-in Redis client, `Bun.RedisClient`, now supports specifying a database number directly in the connection URL, aligning with the standard Redis URI scheme. You can append `/db-number` to your connection string to connect to a specific database without manually sending a `SELECT` command.

```
import { RedisClient } from "bun";
// Connect to database #2
const client = new RedisClient("redis://localhost:6379/2");

// Set a key in DB 2
await client.set("foo", "bar");
console.log(await client.get("foo")); // "bar"

// Connect to the default database #0
const defaultClient = new RedisClient("redis://localhost:6379/0");

// The key "foo" will not be found in DB 0
console.log(await defaultClient.get("foo")); // null
```

Thanks to @HeyItsBATMAN for the contribution

## [`Bun.redis` now supports `hget()`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#bun-redis-now-supports-hget)

Bun's built-in Redis client now supports the `HGET` command. This provides a more ergonomic and performant way to retrieve a single field from a Redis hash, returning the value directly instead of a single-element array like `hmget`. For single-field lookups, `hget()` is approximately 2x faster than `hmget()`.

```
import { redis } from "bun";

// Old way: returns an array
const [value] = await redis.hmget("my-hash", "my-field");

// New way: returns the value directly
const value = await redis.hget("my-hash", "my-field");
```

## [Faster number handling in Bun's APIs](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#faster-number-handling-in-bun-s-apis)

Bun's internal APIs that return numbers, such as `fs.statSync()`, `performance.now()`, and `process.memoryUsage()`, now use a more efficient number representation when the value is a whole number.

Previously, these values were always represented as double-precision floating-point numbers. Now, they can be represented as tagged 32-bit integers, which makes subsequent arithmetic operations on these values significantly faster in JavaScriptCore.

```
// Bun's APIs now return numbers in a more efficient format when possible.
// Operations like this can be faster.
const stats = fs.statSync(file);
const size = stats.size; // This is now a tagged integer if it fits.
```

## [Node.js compatibility improvements:](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#node-js-compatibility-improvements)

* Fixed: A `RangeError` exception in `child_process.spawnSync` when the `stdio` option was configured with `process.stderr` or `process.stdout`. This unblocks usage of tools like the AWS CDK.
* Fixed: A bug where `socket.write()` from `node:net` would incorrectly throw an exception when passed a `Uint8Array`. Now it allows passing `Uint8Array`s, matching Node.js behavior.
* Fixed: A bug where `crypto.verify()` would throw an error when a `null` or `undefined` algorithm was passed for an RSA key. It now correctly defaults to `"SHA256"` to match Node.js behavior.
* Fixed a bug where the N-API function `napi_strict_equals` incorrectly used `Object.is` semantics instead of the `===` operator. This improves compatibility with native modules that rely on strict equality checks, such as `NaN !== NaN`.
* Fixed a crash in the N-API function `napi_call_function` that could occur when the `recv` (the `this` value) argument was a null pointer.
* Fixed `napi_create_array_with_length` to correctly handle negative or oversized lengths, matching Node.js's behavior.
* Fixed: `util.promisify(http2.connect)` now resolves correctly, improving Node.js compatibility for the `http2` module.
* Fixed: In `child_process`, the `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`, and `stdio` properties are now enumerable to match Node.js behavior. This fixes compatibility with libraries like `tinyspawn` and `youtube-dl-exec` that use `Object.assign` on the child process object.
* Fixed: Request body streaming when using `node-fetch` in Bun now works correctly, preventing large request bodies from being fully buffered in memory.
* Fixed: A bug where `Buffer.from(string, 'utf-16le')` produced incorrect output in rare cases. This improves Node.js compatibility.
* Fixed: an incorrect assertion failure in N-API when `napi_reference_unref` is called during garbage collection. This improves compatibility with Node.js and fixes crashes in packages like `rolldown-vite`.
* Fixed: `process.versions.llhttp` was missing, which improves Node.js compatibility.
* Fixed: `module._compile` is now correctly assigned to `require('module').prototype._compile`.
* Fixed: A noisy, un-actionable warning for `async_hooks` is no longer printed to the console by default, especially when using React or Next.js.
* Fixed: `crypto.randomInt` was not calling the callback. Now it does.
* Fixed: `new Buffer.isAscii(string)` now correctly checks for ASCII; it was previously using the `isUtf8` implementation by mistake. This did not impact `Buffer.isAscii(string)`, only `new Buffer.isAscii(string)`, which you probably shouldn't use anyway.
* Improved: error message in `Buffer.concat()` when concatenating buffers larger than 4GB. A `RangeError` is now thrown with a descriptive message.

## [Bundler & minifier improvements:](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#bundler-minifier-improvements)

* Fixed: In `Bun.build`, the `onResolve` and `onLoad` plugin hooks now correctly run for entrypoint files, matching esbuild's behavior. (Thanks to @dylan-conway)
* Fixed: Runtime plugins using `onResolve` now correctly resolve dynamic `import()` calls, which previously could fail with an `ENOENT` error. (Thanks to @dylan-conway)
* Fixed: `Bun.build` now throws an `AggregateError` by default on build failures. To revert to the old behavior, set `{ throw: false }` and inspect the `success` property on the returned `BuildOutput`. (Thanks to @dylan-conway)
* Fixed: A bug where standalone binaries created with `bun --compile` would incorrectly include the executable's name as an extra argument in `process.argv`. This could cause argument parsing libraries like `node:util.parseArgs` to fail.
* Fixed: An assertion failure in `bun build` that could occur when using the `--compile` and `--bytecode` flags together.
* Fixed: Bundler plugins can now intercept entry points with `onResolve`, fixing a bug that prevented the creation of virtual entry points.
* Fixed: A bug where `build.module()` in a Bun plugin would fail to parse TypeScript syntax when using `loader: 'ts'`.
* Fixed: `Bun.build()` was missing the `splitting` property in its TypeScript types.
* Fixed: On Windows, single-file executables created with `bun build --compile` no longer have an incorrect "Original Filename" metadata field set to "bun.exe".
* Fixed: A regression on Windows where `bun build --compile` would fail when using embedded resources or a relative path for `--outfile`.
* Fixed: a memory leak in `Bun.plugin` where `onLoad` filters using regular expressions would not be garbage collected, causing memory usage to grow over multiple builds.
* Fixed: A bug causing non-deterministic module resolution for packages that ship both CommonJS and ES Module versions. This could lead to inconsistent builds and "dual package hazard" errors.
* Fixed: an error when parsing `linear-gradient()` with `turn` angle units.
* Fixed: A bug where certain modules using top-level await were missing a `async` keyword, causing a runtime error.
* Fixed: A bug where `banner` option with `format: "cjs"` and `target: "bun"` could produce a syntax error if `banner` contained a shebang.

## [JavaScript runtime improvements:](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#javascript-runtime-improvements)

* `Bun.YAML.parse` now accepts `Buffer`, `ArrayBuffer`, `TypedArray`s, `DataView`, and `Blob` as input.
* Fixed: `Bun.Cookie.isExpired()` now correctly returns `true` for cookies with an `Expires` date set to the Unix epoch (`Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT`).
* Fixed: an exception in `crypto.subtle.importKey` when importing RSA private keys with Chinese Remainder Theorem parameters. This resolves a compatibility issue with the `jose` JWT library.
* Fixed: a bug that caused `fetch()` requests with large bodies to fail with an `ECONNRESET` error when using an HTTP proxy for an HTTPS connection.
* Fixed: Errors thrown inside `HTMLRewriter` handlers are now correctly propagated as catchable JavaScript errors, instead of causing a `[native code: Exception]` message or a crash.
* Fixed: A reliabiltiy issue in `HTMLRewriter`
* Fixed: an assertion failure when using the `BUN_INSPECT_CONNECT_TO` environment variable in a project that loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
* Fixed: a crash when using `Bun.secrets` on Linux.
* Fixed: `fetch()` throwing a `Decompression error: ShortRead` when receiving an empty response with `Content-Encoding: gzip` and `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`. This also occurred with brotli and zstd in some cases.
* Fixed: A bug where `structuredClone()` would throw a "TypeError: Unable to deserialize data" when cloning nested objects or arrays containing a `Blob` or `File`. Additionally, the `name` property of `File` objects is now correctly preserved after cloning.
* Fixed: A bug causing error stack traces to be truncated, which made debugging more difficult.
* Fixed: A bug causing `fetch()` to hang when the server responds with a `101 Switching Protocols` status, which is used to upgrade a connection to a WebSocket. fetch() in Bun continues to not support WebSocket connections, it now errors instead of hanging.
* Fixed: `new WebSocket()` now emits an `error` event before the `close` event when a connection handshake fails. Previously, only a `close` event was emitted, which was inconsistent with browser behavior.
* `process.versions` now displays semantic versions for `zlib` and `libdeflate` instead of commit hashes.
* Fixed: A regression causing `bun --watch` to crash when a file is deleted.
* Fixed: A bug where `bun --watch` would not correctly handle changes in swap files.

## [Bun.SQL bugfixes:](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#bun-sql-bugfixes)

* Fixed: A regression from Bun v1.2.21 impacting `DATABASE_URL` options precedence in `Bun.SQL` connection string parsing.
* Fixed: A potential crash in `Bun.SQL` when closing a MySQL or PostgreSQL database connection.

## [Shell improvements:](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#shell-improvements)

* Fixed: A shell crash when using environment variable assignments in a pipeline, such as `VAR=val | command`.
* Fixed: A regression from Bun v1.2.21 where certain commands would trigger an assertion failure on Windows.

## [bun install improvements:](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#bun-install-improvements)

* Fixed an internal data structure in `bun patch` to use one-based line indexing by default.
* Fixed: a panic when installing a global package with `--trust` if it contained dependencies that were already trusted.
* Fixed: A crash that could occur during `bun install` when applying a malformed patch file with out-of-bounds line numbers.
* Fixed: A bug where `bun audit` could hang indefinitely due to a cycle in the dependency graph has been resolved.
* Fixed: A bug when extracting tarballs with unusual package names could produce an invalid temporary filename, particularly on Windows.

## [TypeScript types:](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.2.22#typescript-types)

* Fixed: Added missing types for `AbortSignal.aborted` and `RegExp.escape` to `bun-types`.
* Fixed: Added missing TypeScript types for `Bun.YAML.parse`.
