Bun v1.0.18 fixes 27 bugs (addressing 28 👍 reactions). A hang impacting create-vite & create-next & stdin has been fixed. Lifecycle scripts reporting "node" or "node-gyp" not found has been fixed. expect().rejects works like Jest now, and more bugfixes.

Bun is an incredibly fast JavaScript runtime, bundler, transpiler, and package manager — all in one. In case you missed it, here are some of the recent changes to Bun:

* [`v1.0.13`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.13) - Fixes 6 bugs (addressing 317 👍 reactions). 'http2' module & gRPC.js work now. Vite 5 & Rollup 4 work. Implements process.report.getReport(), improves support for ES5 'with' statements, fixes a regression in bun install, fixes a crash when printing exceptions, fixes a Bun.spawn bug, and fixes a peer dependencies bug
* [`v1.0.14`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.14) - `Bun.Glob`, a fast API for matching files and strings using glob patterns. It also fixes a race condition when extracting dependencies during `bun install`, improves TypeScript module resolution in `node_modules`, and makes error messages easier to read.
* [`v1.0.15`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.15) - Fixes 23 bugs (addressing 117 👍 reactions), `tsc` starts 2x faster. Stable `WebSocket` client, syntax-highlighted errors, cleaner stack traces, add custom test matchers with `expect.extend()` + additional expect matchers.
* [`v1.0.16`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.16) - Fixes 49 bugs (addressing 38 👍 reactions). Concurrent IO for Bun.file & Bun.write gets 3x faster and now supports Google Cloud Run & Vercel, Bun.write auto-creates the parent directory if it doesn't exist, `expect.extend` inside of preload works, `napi_create_object` gets 2.5x faster, bugfix for module resolution impacting Astro v4 and p-limit, console.log bugfixes
* [`v1.0.17`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.17) - Fixes 15 bugs (addressing 152 👍 reactions). bun install postinstall scripts run for top 500 packages, `bunx supabase` starts 30x faster than `npx supabase`, `bunx esbuild` starts 50x faster than `npx esbuild` and bugfixes to bun install

## [Fixed: Hang when reading from `process.stdin`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.18#fixed-hang-when-reading-from-process-stdin)

A bug where `Bun.stdin.stream()` or `process.stdin` would sometimes hang after the first read has been fixed, thanks to [@paperclover](https://github.com/paperclover).

This bug impacted many packages, including `create-vite` and `create-next-app`. While it prompts for user input, the terminal would freeze at the second prompt.

Where bun would get stuck

This was caused by two bugs related to our implementation of `process.stdin`, which is built on top of [`Bun.stdin.stream()`](https://bun.sh/guides/process/stdin):

1. We previously called `cancel` on the `ReadableStream` input, closing the stream and preventing the ability to recieve new data. The fix is to use [`releaseLock`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStreamDefaultReader/releaseLock) instead.
2. A bug where after calling `releaseLock`, Bun would think the stream is still "in use", which would keep the process alive forever.

This has been fixed, thanks to [@paperclover](https://github.com/paperclover).

## [Fixed: Lifecycle scripts running in the wrong working directory](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.18#fixed-lifecycle-scripts-running-in-the-wrong-working-directory)

A bug where lifecycle scripts would sometimes run in the wrong working directory has been fixed. This bug was fixed by [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway).

## [Fixed: Lifecycle scripts reporting command not found "node" or "node-gyp"](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.18#fixed-lifecycle-scripts-reporting-command-not-found-node-or-node-gyp)

Yesterday in Bun v1.0.17, we enabled lifecycle scripts for the top 500 packages on npm. While we did plenty of testing ourselves, we missed a few cases that were reported by users.

For example, what happens if `node-gyp` was not installed?

```
bun install
```

```
node-gyp rebuild
```

```
Command not found: node-gyp
```

That's no good. We've fixed this. Now, Bun will symlink `node-gyp` into running `bunx node-gyp` if `node-gyp` is not installed (which will lazily auto-install node-gyp).

Or what if a lifecycle script you're using depends on `node`, but you're running in Docker and the container does not have `node` installed?

```
bun install
```

```
node install.js
```

```
Command not found: node
```

That's not good either. Now Bun will symlink `node` into running `bun` if `node` is not installed.

These have been fixed, thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway).

## [Symlinking `node` to `bun` works better](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.18#symlinking-node-to-bun-works-better)

Bun will automatically symlink `node` to `bun` when it is not available to ensure scripts that expect `node` to exist still work. However, Bun's CLI is very different from Node's, so when running a command like `node build` or `node install`, it is expected to find a file like `build.js`, not invoke a bundler or package manager.

Previously:

```
ln -s $(which bun) node && chmod +x node
```

```
./node build
```

```
bun build v1.0.18 (a648ed9e)
error: Missing entrypoints. What would you like to bundle?

Usage:
  $ bun build <entrypoint> [...<entrypoints>] [...flags]

To see full documentation:
  $ bun build --help
```

Now:

```
./node build
```

```
Hello! (Bun 1.0.18)
```

build.js

```
const isBun = typeof Bun !== 'undefined';
const name = isBun ? "Bun" : "Node";
const version = isBun ? Bun.version : process.version;
console.log(`Hello! (${name} ${version})`)
```

Thanks to [@paperclover](https://github.com/paperclover).

## [Reflinks on Linux](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.18#reflinks-on-linux)

Reflinks are copy-on-write copies of files. They make it faster to copy files. macOS has supported reflinks since APFS was released in 2017. Linux has supported reflinks with brtfs and more recently more filesystems have added support for reflinks.

Bun already used `copy_file_range` on Linux to make copying files faster, but some hypervisors (like gVisor) disable this system call. Now Bun will try to use `ioctl_ficlone`, which is a lower-level system call that internally does something very similar to `copy_file_range`. `ioctl_ficlone` is overall less well-supported than `copy_file_range`, but it's a useful fallback when `copy_file_range` is unavailable.

When `copy_file_range` is disabled but `ioctl_ficlone` is available, you will notice a speed improvement to:

* `bun install`
* `fs.copyFile`, `fs.copyFileSync`
* `fs.cp`, `fs.cpSync`

To force the usage of `ioctl_ficlone`, you can pass `constants.COPYFILE_FICLONE_FORCE` as the `flags` argument to `fs.copyFile` or `fs.cp`:

```
import { copyFileSync, constants } from "fs";

copyFileSync("src/index.js", "dest/index.js", constants.COPYFILE_FICLONE_FORCE);
```

This will throw an error if `ioctl_ficlone` is not available.

## [Fixed: Wildcard tsconfig path not including suffix](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.18#fixed-wildcard-tsconfig-path-not-including-suffix)

A bug where wildcard `tsconfig.json` `paths` would fail to resolve due to the suffix not being added has been fixed

```
error: Cannot find module "@faasjs/bar" from ".../test/js/bun/resolve/resolve-test.js"
```

Thanks to [@james-elicx](https://github.com/james-elicx) for fixing this.

## [Fixed: `expect().rejects.toThrow` works more like Jest](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.18#fixed-expect-rejects-tothrow-works-more-like-jest)

In Jest, `expect().toThrow` requires you pass a function to call. With `expect().rejects.toThrow`, they let you simply pass in the rejecting promise. Bun did not support this case.

The following test now passes in `bun:test`:

rejects-toThrow.test.js

```
test("rejects to octopus", async () => {
  const rejection = Promise.reject(new Error("octopus"));
  await expect(rejection).rejects.toThrow("octopus");
});
```

Thanks to [@paperclover](https://github.com/paperclover) for fixing this.
