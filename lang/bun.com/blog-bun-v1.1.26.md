Bun v1.1.26 is here! This release fixes 9 bugs (addressing 652 👍). `bun outdated` shows outdated dependencies. `Bun.serve()` gets a new `idleTimeout` option for socket timeouts, and `subscriberCount(topic: string)` for a count of websocket clients subscribed to a topic. bun test.only skips all other tests. expect.assertions(n) in async functionn is fixed. "use strict" in CommonJS modules is now preserved. Plus, more node.js compatibility improvements and bug fixes.

We're hiring [systems engineers](https://bun.com/careers) in San Francisco to build the future of JavaScript!

## [`bun outdated` shows outdated dependencies](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.26#bun-outdated-shows-outdated-dependencies)

`bun outdated` is a new subcommand that shows you which dependencies are outdated.

```
bun outdated
```

The `Update` column displays what the next semver-matching version is. The `Latest` column displays the `latest` tagged version from the npm registry.

This was one of the top most upvoted issues on Bun's GitHub repository. Huge thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) for implementing this feature!

## [`test.only` skips all other tests](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.26#test-only-skips-all-other-tests)

Previously, the following would run the first two tests, and skip the third test. This was very confusing! Why did we do it this way!?

```
import { test, describe } from "bun:test";

test("i should not run!", () => {
  // previously: runs
  // now: does not run
  console.log("why am i running?");
});

// ... more tests in a much longer file ...

test.only("i should run!", () => {
  // runs
  console.log("yes only i should run");
});

test("I definitely should not run!", () => {
  // does not run
  console.log("i don't run");
});
```

This was really frustrating because the only way around it was the `--only` CLI flag.

```
bun test --only
```

Now, you don't have to do that. `bun test` will detect there was a `.only` test in the file and skip all the tests that don't have `.only` in them.

The existence of a `.only` test in a file is also reset when the next module starts loading tests. This means that a `.only` will only impact the current file instead of all files.

### [subscriberCount(topic: string) in Bun.serve()](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.26#subscribercount-topic-string-in-bun-serve)

`Bun.serve()`'s builtin-in WebSocket server now supports `subscriberCount(topic: string)` to get the number of websocket clients subscribed to a topic.

```
import { serve } from "bun";

const server = serve({
  port: 3002,
  websocket: {
    open(ws) {
      const count = server.subscriberCount("chat");
      ws.subscribe("chat");
      ws.publish(`chat`, `🐰 #${count} joined the chat`);
    },
  },

  fetch(req, server) {
    return server.upgrade(req);
  },
});
```

### [`idleTimeout` in `Bun.serve()`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.26#idletimeout-in-bun-serve)

You can now set a custom idle timeout (in seconds) for Bun.serve()'s builtin-in HTTP(s) server.

```
import { serve } from "bun";

const server = serve({
  async fetch(req) {
    await Bun.sleep(1000 * 60 * 2); // 2 minutes
    return new Response("Hello, it's been 2 minutes!");
  },
  // minutes:
  idleTimeout: 60 * 4, // 4 minutes
});
```

Previously, this was always set to 10 seconds. The default continues to be 10 seconds, but in cases where you need that to be a longer or shorter amount of time, you can now set it to a different value.

This option was previously only available for connected WebSocket clients, and now it's available for regular HTTP(s) requests as well.

Thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari) for implementing this feature!

### [Fixed: `expect.assertions(n)` in async functions](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.26#fixed-expect-assertions-n-in-async-functions)

`expect.assertions(n: number)` now works as expected in async functions.

The following test that should've failed previously would not have failed.

```
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("this test should NOT pass", async () => {
  expect.assertions(1);
  await Bun.sleep(2);

  // the assertion is commented out.
  // so this test should always fail.
  // expect(1).toBe(1);
});
```

Now, the test will fail:

```
bun test
```

```
bun test v1.1.26

passy.test.ts:
AssertionError: expected 1 assertions, but test ended with 0 assertions
✗ this test should NOT pass [3.57ms]

 0 pass
 1 fail
Ran 1 tests across 1 files. [8.00ms]
```

### [`expect().toThrow()` supports asymmetric matchers](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.26#expect-tothrow-supports-asymmetric-matchers)

You can now use `expect().toThrow()` with asymmetric matchers like `expect.objectContaining()`:

```
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("this test should NOT pass", () => {
  expect(() => {
    const error = new Error("oh no!");
    error.code = "ERR_OH_NO";
    throw error;
  }).toThrow(expect.objectContaining({ message: "oh no!", code: "ERR_OH_NO" }));
});
```

### [Fixed: `done` callback in tests causing a hang](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.26#fixed-done-callback-in-tests-causing-a-hang)

Previously, there were a number of cases where using a `done` callback in `test` would cause the test to hang indefinitely when not called.

For example, this test would fail and then hang forever:

```
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("this test should NOT hang", (done) => {
  process.nextTick(() => {
    throw new Error("oh no!");
    done();
  });
});
```

One could argue, "The `done` callback was never called! It's only logical that it would hang forever!" but that's not the case. The test already failed. It had an uncaught exception. Therefore, the test does not need to hang forever (or timeout). It can fail immediately once all microtasks have been drained and the task queue is empty.

In other words, tests will continue running once all other known work is complete instead of waiting for the `done` callback to be called after an exception is thrown.

### [Fixed: mock().mockName() not returning `this`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.26#fixed-mock-mockname-not-returning-this)

The `mock()` function in Bun's test runner now returns `this`. This is to align the behavior with jest so that existing tests written for jest can be ported to Bun.

## [Node.js compatibility improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.26#node-js-compatibility-improvements)

### [Fixed: Top-level `"use strict"` in CommonJS modules preserved at runtime](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.26#fixed-top-level-use-strict-in-commonjs-modules-preserved-at-runtime)

Previously, Bun would strip a top-level `"use strict"` directive from CommonJS modules at runtime. This was intended for ES modules as it is unnecessary in those cases, but it IS necessary for CommonJS modules and is now fixed.

Preivously, the following code would print "I am globalThis" in Node.js, and "I am undefined" in Bun.

```
// Before:
"use strict";

function whoami() {
  return this;
}

const me = whoami();

if (me === globalThis) {
  console.log("I am globalThis!");
} else {
  console.log("I am undefined!");
}

exports.whoami = whoami;
```

Now, it prints "I am globalThis" in both Node.js and Bun.

### [Fixed: util.inherits bug](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.26#fixed-util-inherits-bug)

A bug where `util.inherits` was using `Object.create` instead of `Object.setPrototypeOf` has been fixed. This caused the snowflake sdk to fail to load.

Thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway) for fixing this bug!

### [Fixed: crypto.randomValues() crash in certain cases](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.26#fixed-crypto-randomvalues-crash-in-certain-cases)

A rare JIT-related crash in `crypto.randomValues()` has been fixed.

### [Fixed: crash in Buffer in certain cases](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.26#fixed-crash-in-buffer-in-certain-cases)

A rare crash in `Buffer` found while running the Node.js test suite has been fixed.

### [Fixed: `ERR_INVALID_THIS` code returned in certain web APIs](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.26#fixed-err-invalid-this-code-returned-in-certain-web-apis)

Node.js' test suite expects certain web APIs to return an error with the `ERR_INVALID_THIS` `code` property.

For compatibility, Bun now returns these errors with the `ERR_INVALID_THIS` code.

### [Fixed: dns.resolveSrv confusing `weight` and `priority`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.26#fixed-dns-resolvesrv-confusing-weight-and-priority)

A bug where the `priority` field was being set to the `weight` field in `dns.resolveSrv` has been fixed, thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari).

### [Fixed: rare crash in fetch()](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.26#fixed-rare-crash-in-fetch)

A rare crash in `fetch()` involving AbortSignal has been fixed, thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari).
