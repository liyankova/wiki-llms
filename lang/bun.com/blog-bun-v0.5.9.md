Bun v0.5.9 introduces watch mode using `bun --watch`, adds support for tarball dependencies in `bun install`, and fixes lots of bugs to improve stability and compatibility.

curl

npm

brew

docker

curl

```
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

npm

```
npm install -g bun
```

brew

```
brew tap oven-sh/bun
```

```
brew install bun
```

docker

```
docker pull oven/bun
```

```
docker run --rm --init --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 oven/bun
```

To upgrade Bun:

```
bun upgrade
```

## [Watch mode](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.9#watch-mode)

Bun now supports watch mode using [`bun --watch`](https://bun.com/docs/runtime/hot#watch-mode), which auto-restarts your application when you make a change to your files. This is useful in development to quickly see changes you've made to your code. It's a builtin replacement for [`nodemon`](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) that is noticeably faster.

Run a file with `bun --watch`

Run tests with `bun test --watch`

Bun still supports [`bun --hot`](https://bun.com/docs/runtime/hot#hot-mode), which attempts to reload your application code without restarting the whole process. This is particularly useful when [developing a server](https://bun.sh/docs/api/http#bun-serve) with `Bun.serve`, especially one long-lived connections like WebSockets. But in most cases `--watch` is a better general purpose tool.

## [Tarball dependencies](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.9#tarball-dependencies)

You can now use tarball dependencies in your `package.json`. Bun will download and install the package from the specified tarball URL, rather than from npm (or whichever package registry you have configured).

package.json

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "zod": "https://registry.npmjs.org/zod/-/zod-3.21.4.tgz"
  }
}
```

Use tarball URLs to include a dependency that is not in a registry or privately hosted.

## [Squashed bugs](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.9#squashed-bugs)

We fixed a lot of bugs this release, here are a few interesting highlights.

* The [`url.origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/origin) property is to `"null"` when the protocol is non-HTTP.

```
test("url.origin is null when protocol is non-http", () => {
  expect(new URL("https://example.com")).toHaveProperty(
    "origin",
    "https://example.com",
  );
  expect(new URL("file://path/to/file")).toHaveProperty("origin", "null");
  expect(new URL("about:blank")).toHaveProperty("origin", "null");
});
```

* `Set-Cookie` headers are no longer de-duplicated.

```
test("headers can handle duplicate set-cookie headers", () => {
  const headers = new Headers([["Set-Cookie", "foo=bar"]]);
  headers.append("set-Cookie", "foo=baz");
  expect([...headers]).toEqual([
    ["set-cookie", "foo=bar"],
    ["set-cookie", "foo=baz"],
  ]);
});
```

* An invalid `Date` now `console.log()` as "Invalid Date".

```
test("invalid date inspects as 'Invalid Date'", () => {
  expect(Bun.inspect(new Date("hello world"))).toBe("Invalid Date");
});
```

* Node.js' `util.isError()` function now works for objects that are "Error-like".

```
test("util.isError() works for non-native errors", () => {
  const actual = util.isError({ name: "Error", message: "an error occurred" });
  expect(actual).toBe(true);
});
```

* We also improved the Error messages when you import a Node.js module that has not been implemented yet in Bun, like `node:http2` and `node:vm`.

## [Looking ahead](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.9#looking-ahead)

A [new JavaScript bundler](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/2312) is coming, including builtin support for [server components](https://react.dev/blog/2020/12/21/data-fetching-with-react-server-components).
