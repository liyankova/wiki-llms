Bun v1.1.17 is here! This release fixes 4 bugs. Fixes a crash in bun repl. Makes fs.readdirSync 5% faster on macOS in small directories. Fixes "ws" module not calling the callback in "send" method. Fixes a crash when reading a corrupted lockfile in bun install. Makes macOS event loop slightly faster.

We're hiring [systems engineers](https://bun.com/careers) in San Francisco to build the future of JavaScript!

### [Fixed: crash in `bun repl`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.17#fixed-crash-in-bun-repl)

In Bun v1.1.16, we upgraded the version of Zig from 0.12.0 to 0.13.0. One of the changes in Zig addressed a bug where immutable strings were being placed into the executable's [data segment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_segment) instead of the read-only data segment (`.rodata`).

This bug, unfortunately, was something that Bun unintentionally relied on.

`bun repl` is an alias of `bunx bun-repl`, which is an unofficial npm package we are planning to rewrite.

When aliasing `bun repl` to `bunx bun-repl`, we were mutating a string that was supposed to be immutable, and due to our poor test coverage of `bun repl`, we didn't catch this bug until it was too late.

This release fixes the crash in `bun repl` and also adds a regression test to prevent this from happening again.

### [5% faster fs.readdirSync on macOS in small directories](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.17#5-faster-fs-readdirsync-on-macos-in-small-directories)

We've optimized the `fs.readdirSync` method to be 5% faster on macOS in small directories.

When calling the macOS `getdirentries64` API, the XNU kernel [adds a flag](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/Libc/blob/899a3b2d52d95d75e05fb286a5e64975ec3de757/gen/FreeBSD/opendir.c#L373-L392) to the end of the buffer to indicate it has reached the end of the list of directory entries.

```
getdirentries64_flags_t *gdeflags =
    (getdirentries64_flags_t *)(dirp->dd_buf + dirp->dd_len -
    sizeof(getdirentries64_flags_t));
*gdeflags = 0;
dirp->dd_size = (long)__getdirentries64(dirp->dd_fd,
    dirp->dd_buf, dirp->dd_len, &dirp->dd_td->seekoff);
if (dirp->dd_size >= 0 &&
    dirp->dd_size <= dirp->dd_len - sizeof(getdirentries64_flags_t)) {
  if (*gdeflags & GETDIRENTRIES64_EOF) {
    dirp->dd_flags |= __DTF_ATEND;
  }
}
```

Previously, Bun was not checking this flag and instead would call `getdirentries64` an extra time, which is an unnecessary system call in every place we read the contents of a directory. Now, we check the flag and avoid the extra system call.

### [Fixed: "ws" module not calling the callback in "send" method](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.17#fixed-ws-module-not-calling-the-callback-in-send-method)

When using a `WebSocket` from the `"ws"` module, the `send` method would not call the callback if the message was successfully sent. This has been fixed.

```
import { WebSocket } from "ws";
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://www.host.com/path");
ws.send("Hello", (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Failed to send message:", err);
  } else {
    console.log("Message sent successfully");
  }
});
```

Previously, the callback would never be called, which impacted libraries relying on the callback. This has been fixed.

### [Fixed: rare crash when reading a corrupted lockfile in `bun install`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.17#fixed-rare-crash-when-reading-a-corrupted-lockfile-in-bun-install)

A bug where Bun would potentially crash when reading a corrupted `bun.lockb` file in `bun install` has been fixed. We added bounds checking and earlier integer underflow/overflow checks to prevent this from happening. We added similar checks when reading cached npm registry manifests as well.

### [macOS event loop gets slightly faster](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.1.17#macos-event-loop-gets-slightly-faster)

Every time background work completes in the event loop, the background thread dispatches a message to wake up the main thread. It's sort of like saying "Hey, wake up! I finished my work!". This step - waking up the main thread - gets very slightly faster on macOS in this release, thanks to some code we borrowed from [libxev](https://github.com/mitchellh/libxev/commit/a42b74ae8139738a14148f94543c659ec2d5b92b). Specifically, we no longer need to allocate memory for each message we send to wake up the main thread.

This change also impacts `bun build`.
