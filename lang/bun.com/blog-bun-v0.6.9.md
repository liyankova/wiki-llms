We're hiring C/C++ and Zig engineers to build the future of JavaScript! [Join our team →](https://bun.com/careers)

We've been releasing a lot of changes to Bun recently, here's a recap in case you missed it:

* [`v0.6.0`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-bundler) - Introducing `bun build`, Bun's new JavaScript bundler.
* [`v0.6.2`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.2) - Performance boosts: 20% faster `JSON.parse`, up to 2x faster `Proxy` and `arguments`.
* [`v0.6.3`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.3) - Implemented `node:vm`, lots of fixes to `node:http` and `node:tls`.
* [`v0.6.4`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.4) - Implemented `require.cache`, `process.env.TZ`, and 80% faster `bun test`.
* [`v0.6.5`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.5) - Native support for CommonJS modules (*previously, Bun did CJS to ESM transpilation*),
* [`v0.6.6`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.6) - `bun test` improvements, including Github Actions support, `test.only()`, `test.if()`, `describe.skip()`, and 15+ more `expect()` matchers; also streaming file uploads using `fetch()`.
* [`v0.6.7`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.7) - Node.js compatibility improvements to unblock Discord.js, Prisma, and Puppeteer
* [`v0.6.8`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.8) - `Bun.password`, function mocking in `bun test`, and a `toMatchObject` expect matcher. Plus an experimental `inspector` mode in `Bun.serve()`.

This release reduces Bun's memory usage across the board and fixes bugs in the bundler/transpiler, CommonJS module loading, `bun run`, and `bun install`.

To install Bun:

curl

npm

brew

docker

curl

```
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

npm

```
npm install -g bun
```

brew

```
brew tap oven-sh/bun
```

```
brew install bun
```

docker

```
docker pull oven/bun
```

```
docker run --rm --init --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 oven/bun
```

To upgrade Bun:

```
bun upgrade
```

## [`Bun.serve()` uses less memory to send strings](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.9#bun-serve-uses-less-memory-to-send-strings)

Bun now supports zero-copy string `Response` bodies in `Bun.serve()`.

We've also applied this optimization to `Response` outside of `Bun.serve()`

Previously, the following code would clone `text` twice:

```
const text = await Bun.file("file.txt").text();

// Copy #1
const response = new Response(text);

// Copy #2
await response.text();
```

Now, it doesn't copy, saving you memory.

## [Cold `bun install` uses 50% less memory](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.9#cold-bun-install-uses-50-less-memory)

We free more memory in `bun install` now, reducing memory usage by 50% for cold installs.

## [Importing modules in Bun's runtime uses less memory](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.9#importing-modules-in-bun-s-runtime-uses-less-memory)

We've fixed a couple memory leaks in Bun that happened when importing modules in Bun's runtime, and improved our bindings with JavaScriptCore for source code management.

[![image](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/assets/709451/b839fda4-fa3d-4abd-b7f5-0573995ac313)](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/assets/709451/b839fda4-fa3d-4abd-b7f5-0573995ac313)

## [Non-ascii filenames](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.9#non-ascii-filenames)

Previously, Bun would throw an error when importing a file with a non-ascii filename.

shell

👋.js

shell

```
bun run 👋.js
```

```
error: FileNotFound reading "/Users/jarred/Desktop/ð.js"
```

👋.js

```
console.log("hello!");
```

This error was caused by both a printing bug and a bug in Bun's JavaScriptCore bindings when reading import identifier names.

## [Bugfixes to mocks in `bun test`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.9#bugfixes-to-mocks-in-bun-test)

`mockResolvedValue` is fixed in `bun test` now. Previously, `mockResolvedValue` would appear to do nothing in `bun test`.

To use `mockResolvedValue`:

```
import { mock, test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("hey", async () => {
  const fn = mock.mockResolvedValue(1);

  expect(fn()).toBeInstanceOf(Promise);

  const value = await fn();

  expect(value).toBe(1); // 1
});
```

The `mock` object returned was missing a `.bind`, `.apply`, `.call`, `.name`, and `.length` functions. This has been fixed. We've also made it so that the `.name` of the mocked function is copied over from the original function automatically.

```
import { mock, test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("hey", async () => {
  const hey = mock(function yo() {
    return 42;
  });

  expect(hey.name).toBe("yo");
});
```

## [Crash in CommonJS `require()` fixed](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.9#crash-in-commonjs-require-fixed)

This release fixes a crash that can occur when many CommonJS files are imported and then the garbage collector is run after the files are no longer in use:

```
import "lodash/omit.js";
import "lodash/findIndex.js";
import "discord.js";

Bun.gc(true);
```

This was a bug in the CommonJS module loader not correctly preventing the function from being garbage collected.

## [A memory leak in `node:crypto` has been fixed](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.9#a-memory-leak-in-node-crypto-has-been-fixed)

This release fixes a memory leak in `node:crypto`. The following code would leak about 192 bytes per call.

```
const crypto = require("crypto");

function sha256(buf) {
  return crypto.createHash("sha256").update(buf).digest();
}

async function main() {
  for (var i = 1000000; i >= 0; i--) {
    const buf = Buffer.alloc(2046);
    const hash = sha256(buf);
    if (i % 1000 === 0) {
      await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 20));
      global.gc ? global.gc() : Bun?.gc(true);
    }
  }
}

main();
```
