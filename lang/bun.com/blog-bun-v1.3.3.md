## [CompressionStream and DecompressionStream](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.3#compressionstream-and-decompressionstream)

Bun now implements [`CompressionStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CompressionStream) and [`DecompressionStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DecompressionStream). These standard Web APIs allow for streaming compression and decompression of data without buffering the entire payload in memory.

In addition to the standard `"gzip"`, `"deflate"`, and `"deflate-raw"` formats, Bun also supports `"brotli"` and `"zstd"`.

```
const response = await fetch("https://example.com");

// Compress the response body using gzip
const compressed = response.body.pipeThrough(new CompressionStream("gzip"));

// Or use zstd for faster compression
const zstd = response.body.pipeThrough(new CompressionStream("zstd"));
```

## [Control .env and bunfig.toml loading in standalone executables](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.3#control-env-and-bunfig-toml-loading-in-standalone-executables)

Standalone executables created with `bun build --compile` normally look for `.env` and `bunfig.toml` files in the directory where the executable is run. You can now disable this behavior at build time using the `--no-compile-autoload-dotenv` and `--no-compile-autoload-bunfig` flags.

This is useful when you want to ensure the executable behaves deterministically, regardless of the configuration files present in the user's working directory.

```
# Disable .env and bunfig.toml loading
bun build --compile --no-compile-autoload-dotenv --no-compile-autoload-bunfig app.ts
```

You can also configure this via the JavaScript API:

```
await Bun.build({
  entrypoints: ["./app.ts"],
  compile: {
    // Disable .env loading
    autoloadDotenv: false,

    // Disable bunfig.toml loading
    autoloadBunfig: false,
  },
});
```

## [`retry` and `repeats` in `bun:test`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.3#retry-and-repeats-in-bun-test)

You can now use the `retry` and `repeats` options in `bun:test`. `retry` runs the callback function up to the specified number of times and if the test passes once then the test passes, while `repeats` runs the callback function up to the specified number of times and if the test fails once then the test fails. This is useful for handling flaky tests.

```
import { test } from "bun:test";

test(
  "flaky test",
  () => {
    if (Math.random() > 0.1) throw new Error("fail");
  },
  { retry: 3 },
);

test(
  "check for flakiness",
  () => {
    // run this 20 times to ensure it's stable
  },
  { repeats: 20 },
);
```

Thanks to @pfgithub for the contribution!

## [--no-env-file](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.3#no-env-file)

You can now disable Bun's automatic `.env` file loading using the `--no-env-file` flag. This is useful in production environments or CI/CD pipelines where you want to rely solely on system environment variables.

```
bun run --no-env-file index.ts
```

This can also be configured in `bunfig.toml`:

```
# Disable loading .env files
env = false
```

Explicitly provided environment files via `--env-file` will still be loaded even when default loading is disabled.

## [SQLite 3.51.0](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.3#sqlite-3-51-0)

`bun:sqlite` has been updated to SQLite v3.51.0.

```
import { Database } from "bun:sqlite";

const db = new Database();
console.log(db.prepare("SELECT sqlite_version()").get());
// { "sqlite_version()": "3.51.0" }
```

## [Internal: Upgraded to Zig 0.15.2](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.3#internal-upgraded-to-zig-0-15-2)

Bun is now built with Zig 0.15.2. This reduces the binary size by 0.8MB and improves build times for contributors.

### [Bundler fixes](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.3#bundler-fixes)

* Fixed: A rare panic in the dev server when processing CSS assets in the incremental graph
* Fixed: A rare panic in the dev server that could occur when a file referenced by a dynamic import is deleted during a reload

### [Node.js compatibility improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.3#node-js-compatibility-improvements)

* Implemented: `_handle.fd` in `node:net` and `node:tls` for better compatibility with libraries that rely on the socket file descriptor
* Fixed: N-API bug preventing `rspack` or `rsbuild` from working

### [Web APIs fixes](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.3#web-apis-fixes)

* Fixed: fuzzer-discovered crash when using JSON.stringify on a FormData object in rare cases

* Fixed: sanitizer-discovered memory leak in `Blob`

### [Bun.serve](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.3#bun-serve)

* Fixed: sanitizer-discovered memory leak in `Bun.listen` when errors are thrown during socket creation

### [YAML](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.3#yaml)

* Fixed: `Bun.YAML.stringify` would incorrectly serialize strings with leading zeros as numbers
* Fixed: A performance issue where YAML merge keys could cause parsing to hang due to exponential complexity

### [Transpiler](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.3#transpiler)

* Fixed: fuzzer-discovered crash in `new Bun.Transpiler()` with invalid configuration

### [Bun.spawn](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.3#bun-spawn)

* Fixed: A small memory leak in `Bun.spawn` when passing extra non-IPC, non-stdout, non-stderr, and non-stdin file descriptors

### [TypeScript definitions](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.3#typescript-definitions)

* Fixed: Added JSDoc documentation for `configVersion` in `BunLockFile` type definition
* Fixed: Added missing `"css"`, `"jsonc"`, `"yaml"`, and `"html"` to the `Loader` type definition
* Fixed: Removed unnecessary dependency on `@types/react` in `@types/bun`

### [Security](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.3.3#security)
