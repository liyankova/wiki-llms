## [node:http gets 14% faster](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.10#node-http-gets-14-faster)

Bun's `node:http` implementation currently wraps [`Bun.serve()`](https://bun.sh/docs/api/http#bun-serve). [`Bun.serve()`](https://bun.sh/docs/api/http#bun-serve) is built on web standards like [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response), which is incompatible with the Node.js [`IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpincomingmessage) and [`ServerResponse`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpserverresponse) classes. That means our wrapper has to do a lot of work to convert between the two.

While fixing a couple bugs, we moved some of the wrapper code which was previously implemented in TypeScript over to native code. This slightly reduced the overhead of the wrapper, making `node:http` 14% faster.

[![hello world node:http](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/assets/709451/aaea8599-26ee-47f0-a9dd-3ac4ef5a057c)](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/assets/709451/aaea8599-26ee-47f0-a9dd-3ac4ef5a057c)

Left: Bun v1.0.10. Right: Bun v1.0.9

### [I want the DETAILS](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.10#i-want-the-details)

We made two changes to improve performance.

When you run [`request.headers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/headers) in Bun, we serialize headers from Bun's web server into a web-standard [`Headers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers) object. Normally, that's great. In this case, `node:http` only used it to convert from the web `Headers` object into a Node.js `headers` object and `rawHeaders` array. The [`Headers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers) object does a lot of extra work behind the scenes - joining strings, normalizing whitespace, and more that the Node.js API does not do.

When you run [`request.url`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/url) in Bun, it parses & normalizes the pathname joined with the `Host` header (when available), producing an absolute URL as a string you can use in `fetch` and with the `URL` constructor. In Node.js, `req.url` is a string containing the raw path and query string (`/path?query`). It's not a valid url. We were doing a lot of extra work to produce a valid URL string and then parse it back a 2nd time to convert into a pathname + query string.

Instead of doing all that work: creating these temporary objects & parsing, we now just create the Node.js `headers` object, `rawHeaders` array, and `url` string in native code.

### [Fixed: multiple Set-Cookie headers in node:http bugfix](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.10#fixed-multiple-set-cookie-headers-in-node-http-bugfix)

As a side effect of moving the above code to native, we also fixed a bug where multiple `Set-Cookie` headers were not being exposed to JavaScript correctly in our `node:http` bindings. This lead to errors like this:

```
undefined is not an object (evaluating 'header.toLowerCase')
```

### [Fixed: "\*\*" cannot be parsed as URL](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.10#fixed-cannot-be-parsed-as-url)

In Node, it's expected that `IncomingMessage` can receive an invalid url string. Previously, Bun was using the `URL` constructor to parse, validate, and normalize the incoming url string, which caused spurious errors like this:

```
TypeError: "*" cannot be parsed as a URL.
      at new IncomingMessage (node:http:420:26)
      at fetch (node:http:383:26)
OPTIONS - * failed
```

Now, Bun just passes the url string through to `node:http`, which is what it expects.

## [Stability improvements to Bun for Linux ARM64/Docker](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.10#stability-improvements-to-bun-for-linux-arm64-docker)

Most software on your computer interacts with the operating system through a layer called the ["C standard library"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library). The C standard library is a set of functions that are implemented by your operating system. For example, when you call `fs.read` in Bun or Node.js, it eventually calls the [`read`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html) function in the C standard library. That `read` function probably just wraps the `read` system call, which is a function implemented by the Linux kernel (or darwin kernel on macOS).

On Linux x64 & arm64, Bun often skips the C standard library and uses Linux system calls directly. This is a little faster, but it also makes error handling sometimes more complicated and means we need to spend more time reading/understanding internals. Our code for reading errors on Linux arm64 was assuming that libc `errno` was always in use, but that isn't true. TLDR: we were sometimes reading `errno` wrong on Linux arm64.

This lead to many strange issues, like:

```
docker-compose up
```

```
my-app-ui-1  | Failed to load PostCSS config: Failed to load PostCSS config (searchPath: /app): [EBADF] Bad file descriptor
my-app-ui-1  | undefined
my-app-ui-1  |    code: "EBADF"
my-app-ui-1  |  syscall: "fstat"
my-app-ui-1  |    errno: -9
my-app-ui-1  |
```

Or like:

```
#8 [4/4] RUN bun install
#8 0.077 bun install v1.0.9 (98f20170)
#8 0.077 error: Unexpected installing typescript
#8 0.077 error: Unexpected installing bun-types
#8 0.077 Failed to install 2 packages
#8 0.078 [2.00ms] done
#8 DONE 0.1s
```

This release fixes those issues.

## [Fixed: Loading extensions in bun:sqlite on macOS](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.10#fixed-loading-extensions-in-bun-sqlite-on-macos)

A bug caused Bun to not support loading extensions in the `bun:sqlite` module on macOS. This has been fixed, thanks to [@paulbaumgart](https://github.com/paulbaumgart).

## [Fixed: Semver parsing bug with pre-releases in bun install](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.10#fixed-semver-parsing-bug-with-pre-releases-in-bun-install)

Bun implements a `node-semver` compatible parser for `bun install`.

There was an edgecase when parsing invalid semver strings that contained a pre-release version with a dist-tag that would potentially cause Bun to crash. This issue has been fixed (thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway)) and we've added more test coverage.

#### Misc

We also updated to the latest version of simdutf.
