# Read a file to a Uint8Array - Bun

The `Bun.file()` function accepts a path and returns a `BunFile` instance. The `BunFile` class extends `Blob` and allows you to lazily read the file in a variety of formats.
To read the file into a `Uint8Array` instance, retrieve the contents of the `BunFile` with `.bytes()`.

Copy

```
const path = "/path/to/package.json";
const file = Bun.file(path);

const byteArray = await file.bytes();

byteArray[0]; // first byteArray
byteArray.length; // length of byteArray
```
