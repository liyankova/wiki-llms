## [What's New](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.1.1#what-s-new)

* Web Streams - `ReadableStream`, `WritableStream`, `TransformStream` and more. This was a massive project. There are still some reliability things to fix, but I'm very happy with the performance, and I think you will be too.
* [`WebSocket`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) is now a global, powered by a custom WebSocket client
* Dynamic `require()`
* 50% faster TextEncoder
* ~30% faster React rendering in production due to a JSX transpiler optimization
* Streaming React SSR is now supported
* Dozens of small bug fixes to the HTTP server
* Discord interactions template by [@evanwashere](https://github.com/evanwashere) in https://github.com/Jarred-Sumner/bun/pull/2
* Group zsh completion options by type by [@alexkuz](https://github.com/alexkuz) in https://github.com/Jarred-Sumner/bun/pull/194
