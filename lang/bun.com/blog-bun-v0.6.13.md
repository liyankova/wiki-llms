## [Mock `Date` in `bun test`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.13#mock-date-in-bun-test)

You can now mock the value of `new Date()` in Bun's test runner. This will affect any API that can retreive the system time, including: [`Date.now()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/now), [`new Date()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/Date), and [`Intl.DateTimeFormat().format()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat).

```
import { test, expect, setSystemTime } from "bun:test";

test("time travel", () => {
  const past = new Date("2022-07-05");
  setSystemTime(past);

  expect(new Date()).toBe(past);
  expect(Date.now()).toBe(past.getTime());
  expect(new Intl.DateTimeFormat("en-US").format()).toBe("07/05/2022");

  setSystemTime(); // resets
  expect(Date.now()).toBeGreaterThan(past.getTime());
});
```

Unlike in Jest, the `Date` object doesn't mutate when you mock the time. This prevents a whole class of confusing test-only bugs.

```
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("Date.prototype", () => {
  const OriginalDate = Date;
  setSystemTime(new Date("2022-07-05"));

  // both pass in Bun, but fail in Jest
  expect(OriginalDate).toBe(Date);
  expect(OriginalDate.now).toBe(Date.now);
});
```

## [Improvements to `node:tls` and `node:net`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.13#improvements-to-node-tls-and-node-net)

@cirospaciari made lots of improvements to Bun's implementation of `node:tls` and `node:net`. This unlocks various npm packages that were dependent on these changes.

### [Postgres with TLS works](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.13#postgres-with-tls-works)

You can now use [`postgres`](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) package to connect to a Postgres database using TLS. Previously, you could connect without TLS, but there were some outstanding issues that prevented TLS from working.

```
import { postgres } from "postgres";

const sql = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URI);
const name = "ThePrimeagen",
  age = 69;
const users = await sql`
  select
    name,
    age
  from users
  where
    name like ${name + "%"}
    and age > ${age}
`;
console.log(users); // [{ name: "ThePrimeagen", age: 69 }]
```

### [Nodemailer works](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.13#nodemailer-works)

You can now use the [`nodemailer`](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer) package to send emails.

```
import nodemailer from "nodemailer";

nodemailer.createTestAccount(async (err, account) => {
  const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    host: account.smtp.host,
    port: account.smtp.port,
    secure: account.smtp.secure,
    debug: true,
    auth: {
      user: account.user,
      pass: account.pass,
    },
  });

  let info = await transporter.sendMail({
    from: '"Fred Foo 👻" <foo@example.com>',
    to: "example@gmail.com",
    subject: "Hello ✔",
    text: "Hello world?",
    html: "<b>Hello world?</b>",
  });

  console.log("Message sent: %s", info.messageId);
  // Message sent: <b658f8ca-6296-ccf4-8306-87d57a0b4321@example.com>

  console.log("Preview URL: %s", nodemailer.getTestMessageUrl(info));
  // Preview URL: https://ethereal.email/message/WaQKMgKddxQDoou...
});
```

## [`.isUtf8()` and `.isAscii()`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.13#isutf8-and-isascii)

You can now use [`isUtf8()`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#bufferisutf8input) and [`isAscii()`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#bufferisasciiinput) from Node's `buffer` module.

```
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";
import { isUtf8, isAscii } from "node:buffer";

test("isUtf8 and isAscii", () => {
  expect(isUtf8(new Buffer("What did the 🦊 say?"))).toBeTrue();
  expect(isAscii(new Buffer("What did the 🦊 say?"))).toBeFalse();
});
```

## [Slightly less memory for HTTP requests](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.13#slightly-less-memory-for-http-requests)

Bun now uses [8 less bytes](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/3483/files#diff-e9484fda309708f80db81a125281dd0b9fdadaf3d2400ae8e78a2b8fc14d85ebR1003-R1025) per HTTP request thanks to Zig's [packed struct](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#packed-struct). This allows us to store the same information in a more memory efficient layout.

In the example below, each `bool` is stored as 1 byte.

```
const Request = struct {
  is_transfer_encoding: bool,
  is_waiting_body: bool,
  // ...
  aborted: bool,
};
```

Now, with a packed struct, each `bool` is stored as 1 *bit*.

```
const Request = struct {
  const Flags = packed struct {
    is_transfer_encoding: bool,
    is_waiting_body: bool,
    // ...
    aborted: bool,
  };
  flags: Flags,
};
```

## [WebSocket client reliability improvements](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.13#websocket-client-reliability-improvements)

This release fixes a number of bugs in Bun's [`WebSocket`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket) client implementation.

### [Zero-length messages are supported](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.13#zero-length-messages-are-supported)

Did you know that you can send & receive zero-length messages with WebSockets? Previously, Bun would ignore those, but now they're supported.

```
const ws = new WebSocket("wss://ws.postman-echo.com/raw");
ws.onopen = () => {
  ws.send("");
  ws.send(new ArrayBuffer(0));
};

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log(event.data); // ""
  console.log(event.data); // ArrayBuffer(0)
};
```

### [Initial payload race condition fix](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.13#initial-payload-race-condition-fix)

Previously, when the initial HTTP response was received and contained websocket message(s) were sent in the same event loop tick, Bun would sometimes ignore the messages. This is now fixed.

Similarly, there was an edgecase where the initial message could be dispatched after a subsequent mesage was received (the 2nd message would appear before the 1st message). This has also been fixed.

## [Bug fixes](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.13#bug-fixes)

### [Changed](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/3484) `.toEqual()` to now ignore private properties (prefixed with `#`).

```
import { test, expect } from "bun:test";

test("toEqual() with #property", () => {
  class Foo {
    bar = 1;
    #baz = "";
  }
  class Bar {
    bar = 1;
  }
  expect(new Foo()).toEqual(new Bar());
});
```

### [Fixed](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/3474) crash with `workspace:` dependency in package.json.

Previously, if you ran `bun add` with the following `package.json`, Bun would crash. This is now fixed.

package.json

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "foo": "workspace:bar"
  }
}
```

### [Fixed](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/3496) zero-length environment variables not working.

Previously, if you ran `bun run` with the following `.env` file, Bun would not detect the environment variable. This is now fixed.

.env

```
FOO=
```

### [Fixed](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/3490) wrong text decoding from `HTMLRewriter`.

Previously, if you can the following code in Bun, it would output the wrong result. This is now fixed.

```
new HTMLRewriter()
  .on("p", {
    element(element) {
      console.log(element.getAttribute("id"));
    },
  })
  .transform(new Response('<p id="Šžõäöü"></p>'));

// Before fix: Å Å¾ÃµÃ¤Ã¶Ã¼
// After fix: Šžõäöü
```

### [Fixed](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/3467) overloads for `Buffer.toString()`.

Previously, if you used `toString()` on a Node.js `Buffer`, Bun would not properly handle the 2nd overload. The 1st overload specifies a start and end, whereas the 2nd overload specified an offset and *length* instead of end.

```
interface Buffer {
  toString(encoding?: BufferEncoding, start?: number, end?: number): string;
  toString(offset: number, length: number, encoding?: BufferEncoding): string;
}
```

```
const { Buffer } = require("node:buffer");
const buf = Buffer.from("hello world", "latin1");

console.log(buf.toString("latin1", 1, 2));
console.log(buf.toString(1, 2, "latin1"));
```

Thanks to [@Hanaasagi](https://github.com/Hanaasagi) for fixing!

### [Fixed](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/3470) missing export from `node:http` module.

We were missing two exports. Oops!

```
var defaultObject = {
   globalAgent,
+  ClientRequest,
+  OutgoingMessage,
   [Symbol.for("CommonJS")]: 0,
};
```

Thanks to [@stijnvanhulle](https://github.com/stijnvanhulle) for fixing!

### [Other bug fixes](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.6.13#other-bug-fixes)

* [Fixed](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/commit/983039a18afccb2f7d78dfdb06724d1ea58edde6) utf-8 decoding for some Node-APIs.
* [Fixed](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/3487) file descriptors leaking when a new JavaScript file is loaded.
