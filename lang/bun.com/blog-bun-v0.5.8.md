## [Snapshot testing with `bun test`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.8#snapshot-testing-with-bun-test)

[`bun test`](https://bun.com/docs/cli/test) aims to be a high-performance, drop-in replacement for Jest. Now it has support for snapshot testing, using [`expect(value).toMatchSnapshot()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing#snapshot-testing-with-jest), which supports the same snapshot format as Jest. Here's how it works:

First, create a test.

snapshot.test.ts

```
import { test, expect } from "bun:test"; // "bun:test" imports are optional

test("can test a snapshot", async () => {
  const response = await fetch("https://example.com/");
  const body = await response.text();
  expect(body).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

Then, run the test file using `bun test`.

```
bun test snapshot.test.ts
```

Next, you'll see the following output in your terminal.

```
 snapshot.test.ts:  
 ✓ can test a snapshot  
   
  1 pass  
  0 fail  
  snapshots: +1 added  
  1 expect() calls  
 Ran 1 tests across 1 files [48.00ms]
```

Finally, you'll see there is a newly-generated snapshot file. Bun uses the same snapshot format as Jest, which means **you don't need to re-generate your snapshots when migrating from Jest to [`bun test`](https://bun.com/docs/cli/test).**

snapshots /snapshot.test.ts.snap

```
exports[`can test a snapshot 1`] = `
"<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Example Domain</title>
</head>
</html>
"
`;
```

If you need to update your snapshots, you can pass the `--update-snapshots` flag, which will update snaphots for every test file that is run.

```
bun test --update-snapshots
```

In addition to `toMatchSnapshot()`, Bun now supports these new matchers:

* [`toThrow(RegExp)`](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect#tothrowerror) (in addition to `toThrow(string|Error)`)
* [`toBeInstanceOf()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect#tobeinstanceofclass) (thanks to [@zhiyuang](https://github.com/zhiyuang))
* [`toMatch()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/expect#tomatchregexp--string) (thanks to [@zhiyuang](https://github.com/zhiyuang))

We also added a flag to re-run a test file multiple times, to help with reproducing errors in flaky tests.

```
bun test --rerun-each=5
```

This reruns each test file 5 times.

## [`bun --preload <preload> [command]`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.8#bun-preload-preload-command)

Bun can now preload files before running a file or a test suite. This behavior is analogous to [`node --require`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#-r---require-module).

To preload a file via the `--preload` flag:

```
bun --preload ./preload.ts run ./index.ts
```

To configure a list of files to `preload` in `bunfig.toml`:

bunfig.toml

```
preload = ["./preload.ts"]
```

This is useful for registering [`plugins`](https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/plugins#usage), injecting globals, or performing setup tasks without cluttering your scripts or entrypoints with extra `import()` or `require()` statements.

Here's an example of how to preload a `Bun.plugin()` to load `.yml` files.

index.ts

config.yml

yaml.plugin.ts

index.ts

```
import config from "./config.yml";

console.log(config);
```

config.yml

```
enabled: true
```

yaml.plugin.ts

```
import { plugin } from "bun";

plugin({
  name: "YAML",
  async setup(build) {
    const { load } = await import("js-yaml");
    const { readFileSync } = await import("fs");

    // when a .yaml file is imported...
    build.onLoad({ filter: /\.(yaml|yml)$/ }, (args) => {

      // read and parse the file
      const text = readFileSync(args.path, "utf8");
      const exports = load(text) as Record<string, any>;

      // and returns it as a module
      return {
        exports: {default: exports, ...exports},
        loader: "object", // special loader for JS objects
      };
    });
  },
});
```

You can now import `.yml` files from your entrypoint:

```
bun --preload ./yaml.plugin.ts index.ts
```

```
{
  enabled: true
}
```

To avoid the `--preload` flag, configure `bunfig.toml`:

bunfig.toml

```
preload = ["./yaml.plugin.ts"]
```

Running `bun test` or `bun run` will now preload the plugin automatically.

```
bun run index.ts
```

```
{
  enabled: true
}
```

## [Partial glob support in `bun install` `workspaces`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.8#partial-glob-support-in-bun-install-workspaces)

The following pattern is now supported in `"workspaces"` with bun install:

```
{
  "name": "myWorkspace",
  "workspaces": [
    // Make all folders with a package.json and a name in packages/ part of the workspace
    "packages/*"
  ]
}
```

You can use a `/*` to add all folders matching the prefix into your workspace. This is useful for monorepos that have many packages.

For now, only a single glob pattern at the very end (`foo/*`) is supported. We plan to improve our glob support in the future. In the meantime, we also added better error messages when a glob pattern isn't implemented yet.

## [Web Compatibility](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.8#web-compatibility)

Thanks to improvements to Bun's test coverage, we've fixed a number of bugs in Bun's Web API compatibility.

### [`request.bodyUsed` & `response.bodyUsed`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.8#request-bodyused-response-bodyused)

[`request.bodyUsed`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/bodyUsed) and [`response.bodyUsed`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/bodyUsed) were inconsistent with the spec when using `null` or `undefined` bodies.

```
const response = new Response(null);

await response.arrayBuffer();

console.log(response.bodyUsed);

/*

Incorrect:

   Bun v0.5.7: true

Correct:

   Bun v0.5.8: false
       Chrome: false
       Safari: false
*/
```

### [Consuming `Request` & `Response` bodies](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.8#consuming-request-response-bodies)

`null` or `undefined` [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) & [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) bodies can now be consumed multiple times, which aligns the behavior with Chrome & Safari.

Previously, Bun would throw an error when trying to consume a `null` or `undefined` body twice:

```
bun-0.5.7 response.js
```

```
1 | const response = new Response(null);
2 | await response.arrayBuffer();
3 | console.log(await response.arrayBuffer());
                ^
error: Body already used
```

Now `.arrayBuffer()` on `null` or `undefined` body returns an empty [`ArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) instead:

```
bun response.js
```

```
ArrayBuffer(0) [ ]

/*

Incorrect:

   Bun v0.5.7: <error> "Body already used"

Correct:

   Bun v0.5.8: ArrayBuffer(0) [ ]
       Chrome: ArrayBuffer(0) [ ]
       Safari: ArrayBuffer(0) [ ]
*/
```

Similarly, [`Response.prototype.body`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/body) is supposed to return `null` when there is no body, but Bun was returning an empty [`ReadableStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream) instead.

```
const response = new Response(null);
console.log(response.body);

/*

Incorrect:

   Bun v0.5.7: ReadableStream { ... }

Correct:

   Bun v0.5.8: null
       Chrome: null
       Safari: null
*/
```

### [`blob.slice()` `contentType` argument](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.8#blob-slice-contenttype-argument)

[`blob.slice`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob/slice) accepts an optional third argument for the `type` of the new [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob). Previously, Bun didn't support this argument.

```
const blob = new Blob(["Hello, world!"], { type: "text/plain" });
const slice = blob.slice(0, 5, "text/html; charset=utf-8");
console.log(slice.type); // "text/html; charset=utf-8"

/*

Incorrect:

   Bun v0.5.7: ""

Correct:

   Bun v0.5.8: "text/html; charset=utf-8"
       Chrome: "text/html; charset=utf-8"
       Safari: "text/html; charset=utf-8"
*/
```

### [`Request` constructor](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.8#request-constructor)

The [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) constructor in Bun had a couple bugs.

When given two arguments, it always expected the first argument to be a string, which is incorrect.

```
// This didn't work: (inconsistent with the spec)
new Request(new Request("https://example.com"), {});

// But any of these did:
new Request(new Request("https://example.com"));
new Request("https://example.com", { method: "POST" });
new Request("https://example.com", {});
```

That has been fixed, and now the first argument can be a string or a [`Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) object.

```
// This works now:
console.log(new Request(new Request("https://example.com"), {}).url);

// "https://example.com"
```

Another bug: the `url` argument was not being validated correctly (validated in `fetch()` but not in `new Request()`)

```
// this is supposed to throw:
const request = new Request("", { method: "POST" });
```

Now it (correctly) throws an error:

```
bun /tmp/app.js
```

```
1 | const request = new Request("", { method: "POST" });
                   ^
error: Failed to construct 'Request': url is required.
```

Bun's test coverage for the `Request` constructor was lacking and Bun's implementation of `fetch` (which does validate) doesn't use the same code path as the `Request` constructor.

## [Node.js compatibility](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.8#node-js-compatibility)

Bun continues to make improvements to Node.js compatibility. Here's what has changed since the last release.

* [Dramatically](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/2341) improved [`Buffer`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer) implementation and is now passing many more Node.js tests
* Implemented [`os.cpus()`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#oscpus) for macOS (previously, was only supported on Linux)
* Implemented [`os.networkInterfaces()`](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#osnetworkinterfaces)
* Added [`AbortSignal`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) support to [`http.Server`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpserver) and [`http.ClientRequest`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#class-httpclientrequest)
* `node:net`'s server function `listen` callback now fires after the server is listening, instead of sometimes firing before the server is listening
* `node:zlib` was missing the export for `constants`

## [`Bun.sleepSync()`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.8#bun-sleepsync)

To fix an inconsistency issue between [`Bun.sleep()`](https://bun.com/docs/api/utils#bun-sleep) and `Bun.sleepSync()`, there is a **breaking change** where `Bun.sleepSync()` now accepts milliseconds, instead of seconds. Using code search on GitHub, we found that most usages were already assuming the units were milliseconds.

```
Bun.sleepSync(1); // sleep for 1 ms (not recommended)
await Bun.sleep(1); // sleep for 1 ms (recommended)
```

## [What's next?](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v0.5.8#what-s-next)

For Bun v0.6, you can expect big changes, including a brand new bundler!

> smaller bundle size than webpack (after minification) [pic.twitter.com/OptyA2TSCY](https://t.co/OptyA2TSCY)

> — Jarred Sumner (@jarredsumner) [March 17, 2023](https://twitter.com/jarredsumner/status/1636597984480862213?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Bun's upcoming bundler intends to make building modern, full-stack JavaScript and TypeScript apps a lot simpler (and faster).

Of course, we continue to make progress towards our priorities of Node.js compatibility, overall stability, and performance as Bun inches closer to a 1.0 release. To measure progress towards these goals we've dramatically increased our test coverage of Bun, Node.js, and standard-Web APIs. Stay tunned.
