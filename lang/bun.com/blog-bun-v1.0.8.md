## [`require()` uses up to 30% less memory](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.8#require-uses-up-to-30-less-memory)

We discovered a memory leak when using `require()`, which was introduced when some of Bun's built-in modules were refactored from ESM to CommonJS. We've also added a small performance optimization to Bun's JavaScript parser for large files that create many scopes.

Bun v1.0.7: (before)

```
❯ bun discordy.js
[92.39ms] require("discord.js")
Memory: 73.5625 MB
```

Bun v1.0.8: (after)

```
❯ bun discordy.js
[90.22ms] require("discord.js")
Memory: 55.1875 MB
```

## [Module mocking in `bun test`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.8#module-mocking-in-bun-test)

`bun test` now supports module mocking.

* Module mocks support both ESM and CJS.
* Existing imports are updated in-place. This means module mocks work at runtime (unlike other test runners, which do it at build time).
* You can override builtins, local files, and packages.

```
import { mock, test, expect } from "bun:test";
import { fn, iCallFn, variable } from "./mock-module-fixture";

test("mocking a local file", async () => {
  expect(fn()).toEqual(42);
  expect(variable).toEqual(7);

  mock.module("./mock-module-fixture.ts", () => {
    return {
      fn: () => 1,
      variable: 8,
    };
  });
  expect(fn()).toEqual(1);
  expect(variable).toEqual(8);

  mock.module("./mock-module-fixture.ts", () => {
    return {
      fn: () => 2,
      variable: 9,
    };
  });
  expect(fn()).toEqual(2);
  expect(variable).toEqual(9);

  mock.module("./mock-module-fixture.ts", () => {
    return {
      fn: () => 3,
      variable: 10,
    };
  });
  expect(fn()).toEqual(3);
  expect(variable).toEqual(10);

  expect(require("./mock-module-fixture").fn()).toBe(3);
  expect(require("./mock-module-fixture").variable).toBe(10);
  expect(iCallFn()).toBe(3);
});
```

## [`bun install` peer dependency duplicate version bugfix](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.8#bun-install-peer-dependency-duplicate-version-bugfix)

Previously, `bun install` would always resolve the most recent version of a peer dependency, even if it was already installed. This could cause duplicate versions of the same package to be installed, which would increase the size of `node_modules` and potentially cause conflicts. This has been fixed thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway).

```
bar@1.0.1
foo@1.0.0
bar@^1.0.1
```

Bun v1.0.7: (before)

```
bar@1.0.1
bar@1.0.2
```

Bun v1.0.8: (after)

```
bar@1.0.1
```

## [`bun install` respects ordering of pre-release tags](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.8#bun-install-respects-ordering-of-pre-release-tags)

A bug causing `bun install` to not respect the ordering of pre-release tags has been fixed, thanks to [@dylan-conway](https://github.com/dylan-conway). Previously, Bun would only sort the pre-release tag lexicographically, but now it also sorts by semver presedence, if one exists.

package.json

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "foo": "^1.0.0-beta.0.0.1"
  }
}
```

## [Bug fixes](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.8#bug-fixes)

### [Fixed: `Bun.spawn` not working in Google Cloud, Vercel, and older Linux kernels](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.8#fixed-bun-spawn-not-working-in-google-cloud-vercel-and-older-linux-kernels)

`Bun.spawn` is implemented using a syscall, `pidfd_open`, which is not implemented by gVisor (includes Google Cloud Platform and Vercel) and by older Linux kernels. We implemented a workaround where Bun spawns a thread, enqueue concurrent tasks, then calls `waitpid` on each pid. This workaround is loosely based on libuv's default behavior.

If you encountered this error, upgrade to Bun v1.0.7 and it should now work.

```
// This error is fixed:
error: "pidfd_open(2)" system call is not supported by your Linux kernel
```

### [Fixed: `Bun.spawn` on macOS sometimes not detecting process exit](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.8#fixed-bun-spawn-on-macos-sometimes-not-detecting-process-exit)

A longstanding bug in `Bun.spawn` on macOS has been fixed. Previously, `Bun.spawn()` on macOS might fail to detect when the process exited when the event came shortly before a signal was sent. This was due to a race condition in event notifications from kqueue where the process might receive a notification from the operating system, but has not exited yet and then when we subscribe to notifications from the operating to detect when the process exits, it would tell us it exited.

In text-speak, the bug was this:

**macOS**: "hey something happened with process 123456"

**bun**: "cool, did process 123456 exit?"

**macOS**: "no"

**bun**: "ok...tell me when process 123456 exits"

**macOS**: "i can't tell u because it already exited"

**bun**: "???"

Now, we handle this case by recognizing when macOS reports it already exited after previously reporting it hadn't exited yet.

### [Fixed: `process.stdin` not sending `close` event](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.8#fixed-process-stdin-not-sending-close-event)

When Bun was done reading from `process.stdin`, it would not send a `close` event. This has been fixed, thanks to [@liz3](https://github.com/liz3).

### [Fixed: `setTimeout(cb, 0)` behaved incorrectly](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.8#fixed-settimeout-cb-0-behaved-incorrectly)

`setTimeout` now has a minimum duration of `1`, which aligns with the behaviour of Node.js and browsers. Previously, `setTimeout` with `0` would cause weird behavior, such as infinite loops when the task queue was being drained before moving on to the next tick.

### [Fixed: `setImmediate()` behaved incorrectly](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.8#fixed-setimmediate-behaved-incorrectly)

`setImmediate` now has a separate task queue, which aligns `setImmediate` with what Node.js does. Previously, `setImmediate` was similar to `queueMicrotask` which was incorrect.

### [Fixed: `server.requestIP` sometimes returning bad IP addresses](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.8#fixed-server-requestip-sometimes-returning-bad-ip-addresses)

A bug causing `server.requestIP` to sometimes return malformed IP addresses has been fixed, thanks to [@Hanaasagi](https://github.com/Hanaasagi).

Bun v1.0.7: (before)

```
{
  "address": "4294967232.4294967208.68.57",
  "family": "IPv4",
  "port": 40174
}
```

Bun v1.0.8: (after)

```
{
  "address": "192.168.68.57",
  "family": "IPv4",
  "port": 40174
}
```

### [Fixed: Edgecase with `util.promisify` and `node:dns`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.8#fixed-edgecase-with-util-promisify-and-node-dns)

A bug causing `util.promisify` to not work correctly with `node:dns` has been fixed, thanks to [@antongolub](https://github.com/antongolub).

Bun v1.0.7: (incorrect)

```
const { promisify } = require("node:util");
const { lookup } = require("node:dns");

await promisify(lookup)("example.com"); // "45.33.20.235"
```

Bun v1.0.8: (correct)

```
const { promisify } = require("node:util");
const { lookup } = require("node:dns");

await promisify(lookup)("example.com"); // { address: "45.33.20.235", family: 4 }
```

### [Fixed: Crash when calling `Script` or `File` without `new`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.8#fixed-crash-when-calling-script-or-file-without-new)

Thanks to [@krk](https://github.com/krk) for fixing a crash when invoking certain classes without `new`. We have plans to mitigate this class of bug by improving our API bindings.

Bun v1.0.7: (before)

```
File(); // <crash>
Script(); // <crash>
```

Bun v1.0.8: (after)

```
File(); // "Class constructor File cannot be invoked without 'new'"
Script(); // "Class constructor Script cannot be invoked without 'new'"
```

### [Fixed: Minifier printing bug with `case undefined`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.8#fixed-minifier-printing-bug-with-case-undefined)

Thanks to [@krk](https://github.com/krk) for fixing a bug where `case undefined` was minified to have a missing whitespace, causing invalid JavaScript syntax.

```
switch (true) {
  case undefined: {
  }
}
```

Bun v1.0.7: (before)

```
switch(true){caseundefined:{}} // SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'caseundefined'
```

Bun v1.0.8: (after)

```
switch(true){case undefined:{}}
```

### [Fixed: Edgecases with macros causing a crash](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.8#fixed-edgecases-with-macros-causing-a-crash)

There were some edgecases when using macros that would cause a crash, instead of showing the underlying error. This has been fixed, thanks to [@I-A-S](https://github.com/I-A-S).

### [Fixed: Incorrect behviour for `Buffer.readUintBE`](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.8#fixed-incorrect-behviour-for-buffer-readuintbe)

There was an decoding bug that caused `Buffer.readUintBE` to return incorrect values in certain cases. Thanks to [@Hanaasagi](https://github.com/Hanaasagi) for fixing this issue.

### [Fixed: `fetch()` not throwing an error for untrusted certificates](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.8#fixed-fetch-not-throwing-an-error-for-untrusted-certificates)

A bug in error handling code for BoringSSL in fetch led to Bun not throwing an error when server certificates in `fetch()` failed to verify and inadvertently ignoring some errors from BoringSSL.

Thanks to [@ansg191](https://github.com/ansg191) for discovering and reporting this issue. Thanks to [@cirospaciari](https://github.com/cirospaciari) for implementing a fix and improving our test coverage.

### [New: Support for printing `Map` and `Set` iterators](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.8#new-support-for-printing-map-and-set-iterators)

Bun will now print `Map` and `Set` iterators in `console.log`, thanks to [@liz3](https://github.com/liz3).

```
const set = new Set([1, "123", { a: [], str: "123123132", nr: 3453 }]);
console.log(set.keys());
```

```
SetIterator {
  1,
  "123",
  {
    a: [],
    str: "123123132",
    nr: 3453
  },
}
```
