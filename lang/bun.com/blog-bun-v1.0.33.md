## [Fixed: mv command in Bun Shell](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.33#fixed-mv-command-in-bun-shell)

In Bun v1.0.31, the `mv` command in Bun Shell regressed and in several scenarios would not move files and instead throw an error.

This has been fixed thanks to [@zackradisic](https://github.com/zackradisic), and we've added tests to prevent this from happening again.

## [Fixed: node:crypto id values for sign function](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.33#fixed-node-crypto-id-values-for-sign-function)

Our `node:crypto` implementation was missing the `id` values for the `sign` functions. This has been fixed.

The `node-forge` and `acme-client` npm packages now work in Bun, thanks to [@zenshixd](https://github.com/zenshixd).

## [Windows support is close](https://bun.com/blog/bun-v1.0.33#windows-support-is-close)

We are close to shipping Windows support with Bun v1.1. Once Bun for Windows passes 95% of Bun's test suite, we will announce the release date.

> Bun for Windows currently passes 92.51% of Bun's test suite
