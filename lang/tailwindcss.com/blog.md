[Vanilla JavaScript support for Tailwind Plus](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/vanilla-js-support-for-tailwind-plus)

There are a lot of UI blocks in Tailwind Plus that need JavaScript to really be useful, like dialogs, dropdowns, command palettes, and more. And unless you're a React or Vue user, using those UI blocks has always meant writing all of that tricky JavaScript yourself. Well today that finally changes — every UI block in Tailwind Plus is now fully functional, accessible, and interactive, including the plain HTML examples.

It's been a while since I've written about what we've been working on so I have a lot to share! Too much honestly — my main motivator for even getting this update out is that we've got even more stuff coming next week, and I feel like I'm not allowed to share that stuff until I share all of the stuff we've already shipped. So put your swim suit on, sit back in your lounge chair, and prepare to soak up some vitamin CSS.

One of the hardest constraints we've had to deal with as we've improved Tailwind CSS over the years is the generated file size in development. With enough customizations to your config file, the generated CSS can reach 10mb or more, and there's only so much CSS that build tools and even the browser itself will comfortably tolerate.

Imagine you're implementing a beautiful design you or someone on your team carefully crafted in Figma. You've nailed all the different layouts at each breakpoint, perfected the whitespace and typography, and the photography you're using is really bringing the design to life.  
  
It looks totally amazing — until you connect it your actual production content and realize that your beautiful grid of blog cards falls apart because, of course, *real* article excerpts aren't all magically exactly three lines long, and now each card is a different height.  
  
Sound familiar? If so, the line-clamp plugin is here to save your bacon.
