## [§](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html#the-rust-prelude)The Rust Prelude

Rust comes with a variety of things in its standard library. However, if
you had to manually import every single thing that you used, it would be
very verbose. But importing a lot of things that a program never uses isn’t
good either. A balance needs to be struck.

The *prelude* is the list of things that Rust automatically imports into
every Rust program. It’s kept as small as possible, and is focused on
things, particularly traits, which are used in almost every single Rust
program.

## [§](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html#other-preludes)Other preludes

Preludes can be seen as a pattern to make using multiple types more
convenient. As such, you’ll find other preludes in the standard library,
such as [`std::io::prelude`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/prelude/index.html "mod std::io::prelude"). Various libraries in the Rust ecosystem may
also define their own preludes.

The difference between ‘the prelude’ and these other preludes is that they
are not automatically `use`’d, and must be imported manually. This is still
easier than importing all of their constituent components.

The items included in the prelude depend on the edition of the crate.
The first version of the prelude is used in Rust 2015 and Rust 2018,
and lives in [`std::prelude::v1`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/v1/index.html "mod std::prelude::v1").
[`std::prelude::rust_2015`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/rust_2015/index.html "mod std::prelude::rust_2015") and [`std::prelude::rust_2018`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/rust_2018/index.html "mod std::prelude::rust_2018") re-export this prelude.
It re-exports the following:

* `std::marker::{Copy, Send, Sized, Sync, Unpin}`,
  marker traits that indicate fundamental properties of types.
* `std::ops::{Fn, FnMut, FnOnce}`, and their analogous
  async traits, `std::ops::{AsyncFn, AsyncFnMut, AsyncFnOnce}`.
* `std::ops::Drop`, for implementing destructors.
* `std::mem::drop`, a convenience function for explicitly
  dropping a value.
* `std::mem::{size_of, size_of_val}`, to get the size of
  a type or value.
* `std::mem::{align_of, align_of_val}`, to get the
  alignment of a type or value.
* `std::boxed::Box`, a way to allocate values on the heap.
* `std::borrow::ToOwned`, the conversion trait that defines
  [`to_owned`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/borrow/trait.ToOwned.html#tymethod.to_owned "method std::borrow::ToOwned::to_owned"), the generic method for creating an owned type from a
  borrowed type.
* `std::clone::Clone`, the ubiquitous trait that defines
  [`clone`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html#tymethod.clone "method std::clone::Clone::clone"), the method for producing a copy of a value.
* `std::cmp::{PartialEq, PartialOrd, Eq, Ord}`, the
  comparison traits, which implement the comparison operators and are often
  seen in trait bounds.
* `std::convert::{AsRef, AsMut, Into, From}`, generic
  conversions, used by savvy API authors to create overloaded methods.
* `std::default::Default`, types that have default values.
* `std::iter::{Iterator, Extend, IntoIterator, DoubleEndedIterator, ExactSizeIterator}`,
  iterators of various
  kinds.
* `std::option::Option::{self, Some, None}`, a
  type which expresses the presence or absence of a value. This type is so
  commonly used, its variants are also exported.
* `std::result::Result::{self, Ok, Err}`, a type
  for functions that may succeed or fail. Like [`Option`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html "enum std::option::Option"), its variants are
  exported as well.
* `std::string::{String, ToString}`, heap-allocated strings.
* `std::vec::Vec`, a growable, heap-allocated vector.

The prelude used in Rust 2021, [`std::prelude::rust_2021`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/rust_2021/index.html "mod std::prelude::rust_2021"), includes all of the above,
and in addition re-exports:

* `std::convert::{TryFrom, TryInto}`.
* `std::iter::FromIterator`.

The prelude used in Rust 2024, [`std::prelude::rust_2024`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/rust_2024/index.html "mod std::prelude::rust_2024"), includes all of the above,
and in addition re-exports:

* `std::future::{Future, IntoFuture}`.
