## [§](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html#the-rust-standard-library)The Rust Standard Library

The Rust Standard Library is the foundation of portable Rust software, a
set of minimal and battle-tested shared abstractions for the [broader Rust
ecosystem](https://crates.io). It offers core types, like [`Vec<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html "struct std::vec::Vec") and
[`Option<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html "enum std::option::Option"), library-defined [operations on language
primitives](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html#primitives), [standard macros](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html#macros), [I/O](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/index.html "mod std::io") and
[multithreading](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/index.html "mod std::thread"), among [many other things](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html#what-is-in-the-standard-library-documentation).

`std` is available to all Rust crates by default. Therefore, the
standard library can be accessed in [`use`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-02-defining-modules-to-control-scope-and-privacy.html) statements through the path
`std`, as in [`use std::env`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/env/index.html).

## [§](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html#how-to-read-this-documentation)How to read this documentation

If you already know the name of what you are looking for, the fastest way to
find it is to use the [search
button](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html) at the top of the page.

Otherwise, you may want to jump to one of these useful sections:

* [`std::*` modules](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html#modules)
* [Primitive types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html#primitives)
* [Standard macros](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html#macros)
* [The Rust Prelude](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html "mod std::prelude")

If this is your first time, the documentation for the standard library is
written to be casually perused. Clicking on interesting things should
generally lead you to interesting places. Still, there are important bits
you don’t want to miss, so read on for a tour of the standard library and
its documentation!

Once you are familiar with the contents of the standard library you may
begin to find the verbosity of the prose distracting. At this stage in your
development you may want to press the
“ Summary”
button near the top of the page to collapse it into a more skimmable view.

While you are looking at the top of the page, also notice the
“Source” link. Rust’s API documentation comes with the source
code and you are encouraged to read it. The standard library source is
generally high quality and a peek behind the curtains is
often enlightening.

## [§](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html#what-is-in-the-standard-library-documentation)What is in the standard library documentation?

First of all, The Rust Standard Library is divided into a number of focused
modules, [all listed further down this page](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html#modules). These modules are
the bedrock upon which all of Rust is forged, and they have mighty names
like [`std::slice`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/slice/index.html "mod std::slice") and [`std::cmp`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/index.html "mod std::cmp"). Modules’ documentation typically
includes an overview of the module along with examples, and are a smart
place to start familiarizing yourself with the library.

Second, implicit methods on [primitive types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-02-data-types.html) are documented here. This can
be a source of confusion for two reasons:

1. While primitives are implemented by the compiler, the standard library
   implements methods directly on the primitive types (and it is the only
   library that does so), which are [documented in the section on
   primitives](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html#primitives).
2. The standard library exports many modules *with the same name as
   primitive types*. These define additional items related to the primitive
   type, but not the all-important methods.

So for example there is a [page for the primitive type
`i32`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.i32.html "primitive i32") that lists all the methods that can be called on
32-bit integers (very useful), and there is a [page for the module
`std::i32`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/i32/index.html "mod std::i32") that documents the constant values [`MIN`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/i32/constant.MIN.html "constant std::i32::MIN") and [`MAX`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/i32/constant.MAX.html "constant std::i32::MAX") (rarely
useful).

Note the documentation for the primitives [`str`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html "primitive str") and [`[T]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html "primitive slice") (also
called ‘slice’). Many method calls on [`String`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html "struct std::string::String") and [`Vec<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html "struct std::vec::Vec") are actually
calls to methods on [`str`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html "primitive str") and [`[T]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html "primitive slice") respectively, via [deref
coercions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-02-deref.html#implicit-deref-coercions-with-functions-and-methods).

Third, the standard library defines [The Rust Prelude](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html "mod std::prelude"), a small collection
of items - mostly traits - that are imported into every module of every
crate. The traits in the prelude are pervasive, making the prelude
documentation a good entry point to learning about the library.

And finally, the standard library exports a number of standard macros, and
[lists them on this page](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html#macros) (technically, not all of the standard
macros are defined by the standard library - some are defined by the
compiler - but they are documented here the same). Like the prelude, the
standard macros are imported by default into all crates.

## [§](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html#a-tour-of-the-rust-standard-library)A Tour of The Rust Standard Library

The rest of this crate documentation is dedicated to pointing out notable
features of The Rust Standard Library.

### [§](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html#containers-and-collections)Containers and collections

The [`option`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/index.html "mod std::option") and [`result`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/index.html "mod std::result") modules define optional and error-handling
types, [`Option<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html "enum std::option::Option") and [`Result<T, E>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html "enum std::result::Result"). The [`iter`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/index.html "mod std::iter") module defines
Rust’s iterator trait, [`Iterator`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html "trait std::iter::Iterator"), which works with the [`for`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-05-control-flow.html#looping-through-a-collection-with-for) loop to
access collections.

The standard library exposes three common ways to deal with contiguous
regions of memory:

* [`Vec<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html "struct std::vec::Vec") - A heap-allocated *vector* that is resizable at runtime.
* [`[T; N]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.array.html "primitive array") - An inline *array* with a fixed size at compile time.
* [`[T]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html "primitive slice") - A dynamically sized *slice* into any other kind of contiguous
  storage, whether heap-allocated or not.

Slices can only be handled through some kind of *pointer*, and as such come
in many flavors such as:

* `&[T]` - *shared slice*
* `&mut [T]` - *mutable slice*
* [`Box<[T]>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/index.html "mod std::boxed") - *owned slice*

[`str`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html "primitive str"), a UTF-8 string slice, is a primitive type, and the standard library
defines many methods for it. Rust [`str`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html "primitive str")s are typically accessed as
immutable references: `&str`. Use the owned [`String`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html "struct std::string::String") for building and
mutating strings.

For converting to strings use the [`format!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.format.html "macro std::format") macro, and for converting from
strings use the [`FromStr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/trait.FromStr.html "trait std::str::FromStr") trait.

Data may be shared by placing it in a reference-counted box or the [`Rc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html "struct std::rc::Rc")
type, and if further contained in a [`Cell`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.Cell.html "struct std::cell::Cell") or [`RefCell`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html "struct std::cell::RefCell"), may be mutated
as well as shared. Likewise, in a concurrent setting it is common to pair an
atomically-reference-counted box, [`Arc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html "struct std::sync::Arc"), with a [`Mutex`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html "struct std::sync::Mutex") to get the same
effect.

The [`collections`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/index.html "mod std::collections") module defines maps, sets, linked lists and other
typical collection types, including the common [`HashMap<K, V>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html "struct std::collections::HashMap").

### [§](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html#platform-abstractions-and-io)Platform abstractions and I/O

Besides basic data types, the standard library is largely concerned with
abstracting over differences in common platforms, most notably Windows and
Unix derivatives.

Common types of I/O, including [files](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/struct.File.html "struct std::fs::File"), [TCP](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.TcpStream.html "struct std::net::TcpStream"), and [UDP](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/struct.UdpSocket.html "struct std::net::UdpSocket"), are defined in
the [`io`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/index.html "mod std::io"), [`fs`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/index.html "mod std::fs"), and [`net`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/index.html "mod std::net") modules.

The [`thread`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/index.html "mod std::thread") module contains Rust’s threading abstractions. [`sync`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/index.html "mod std::sync")
contains further primitive shared memory types, including [`atomic`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/index.html "mod std::sync::atomic"), [`mpmc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpmc/index.html "mod std::sync::mpmc") and
[`mpsc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/index.html "mod std::sync::mpsc"), which contains the channel types for message passing.

## [§](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html#use-before-and-after-main)Use before and after `main()`

Many parts of the standard library are expected to work before and after `main()`;
but this is not guaranteed or ensured by tests. It is recommended that you write your own tests
and run them on each platform you wish to support.
This means that use of `std` before/after main, especially of features that interact with the
OS or global state, is exempted from stability and portability guarantees and instead only
provided on a best-effort basis. Nevertheless bug reports are appreciated.

On the other hand `core` and `alloc` are most likely to work in such environments with
the caveat that any hookable behavior such as panics, oom handling or allocators will also
depend on the compatibility of the hooks.

Some features may also behave differently outside main, e.g. stdio could become unbuffered,
some panics might turn into aborts, backtraces might not get symbolicated or similar.

Non-exhaustive list of known limitations:

* after-main use of thread-locals, which also affects additional features:
  + [`thread::current()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.current.html "fn std::thread::current")
* under UNIX, before main, file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 may be unchanged
  (they are guaranteed to be open during main,
  and are opened to /dev/null O\_RDWR if they weren’t open on program start)
