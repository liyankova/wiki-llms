# Macro dbg

1.32.0 · [Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/std/macros.rs.html#352-381)

```
macro_rules! dbg {
    () => { ... };
    ($val:expr $(,)?) => { ... };
    ($($val:expr),+ $(,)?) => { ... };
}
```

Expand description

Prints and returns the value of a given expression for quick and dirty
debugging.

An example:

```
let a = 2;
let b = dbg!(a * 2) + 1;
//      ^-- prints: [src/main.rs:2:9] a * 2 = 4
assert_eq!(b, 5);
```

The macro works by using the `Debug` implementation of the type of
the given expression to print the value to [stderr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_error_(stderr)) along with the
source location of the macro invocation as well as the source code
of the expression.

Invoking the macro on an expression moves and takes ownership of it
before returning the evaluated expression unchanged. If the type
of the expression does not implement `Copy` and you don’t want
to give up ownership, you can instead borrow with `dbg!(&expr)`
for some expression `expr`.

The `dbg!` macro works exactly the same in release builds.
This is useful when debugging issues that only occur in release
builds or when debugging in release mode is significantly faster.

Note that the macro is intended as a debugging tool and therefore you
should avoid having uses of it in version control for long periods
(other than in tests and similar).
Debug output from production code is better done with other facilities
such as the [`debug!`](https://docs.rs/log/*/log/macro.debug.html) macro from the [`log`](https://crates.io/crates/log) crate.

## [§](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.dbg.html#stability)Stability

The exact output printed by this macro should not be relied upon
and is subject to future changes.

## [§](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.dbg.html#panics)Panics

Panics if writing to `io::stderr` fails.

With a method call:

```
fn foo(n: usize) {
    if let Some(_) = dbg!(n.checked_sub(4)) {
        // ...
    }
}

foo(3)
```

This prints to [stderr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_error_(stderr)):

```
[src/main.rs:2:22] n.checked_sub(4) = None
```

Naive factorial implementation:

```
fn factorial(n: u32) -> u32 {
    if dbg!(n <= 1) {
        dbg!(1)
    } else {
        dbg!(n * factorial(n - 1))
    }
}

dbg!(factorial(4));
```

This prints to [stderr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_error_(stderr)):

```
[src/main.rs:2:8] n <= 1 = false
[src/main.rs:2:8] n <= 1 = false
[src/main.rs:2:8] n <= 1 = false
[src/main.rs:2:8] n <= 1 = true
[src/main.rs:3:9] 1 = 1
[src/main.rs:7:9] n * factorial(n - 1) = 2
[src/main.rs:7:9] n * factorial(n - 1) = 6
[src/main.rs:7:9] n * factorial(n - 1) = 24
[src/main.rs:9:1] factorial(4) = 24
```

The `dbg!(..)` macro moves the input:

[ⓘ](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.dbg.html "This example deliberately fails to compile")

```
/// A wrapper around `usize` which importantly is not Copyable.
#[derive(Debug)]
struct NoCopy(usize);

let a = NoCopy(42);
let _ = dbg!(a); // <-- `a` is moved here.
let _ = dbg!(a); // <-- `a` is moved again; error!
```

You can also use `dbg!()` without a value to just print the
file and line whenever it’s reached.

Finally, if you want to `dbg!(..)` multiple values, it will treat them as
a tuple (and return it, too):

```
assert_eq!(dbg!(1usize, 2u32), (1, 2));
```

However, a single argument with a trailing comma will still not be treated
as a tuple, following the convention of ignoring trailing commas in macro
invocations. You can use a 1-tuple directly if you need one:

```
assert_eq!(1, dbg!(1u32,)); // trailing comma ignored
assert_eq!((1,), dbg!((1u32,))); // 1-tuple
```
