# What is rustc? - The rustc book

# [What is rustc?](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/index.html#what-is-rustc)

Welcome to "The rustc book"! `rustc` is the compiler for the Rust programming
language, provided by the project itself. Compilers take your source code and
produce binary code, either as a library or executable.

Most Rust programmers don't invoke `rustc` directly, but instead do it through
[Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html). It's all in service of `rustc` though! If you
want to see how Cargo calls `rustc`, you can

```
$ cargo build --verbose
```

And it will print out each `rustc` invocation. This book can help you
understand what each of these options does. Additionally, while most
Rustaceans use Cargo, not all do: sometimes they integrate `rustc` into other
build systems. This book should provide a guide to all of the options you'd
need to do so.

## [Basic usage](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/index.html#basic-usage)

Let's say you've got a little hello world program in a file `hello.rs`:

```
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

To turn this source code into an executable, you can use `rustc`:

```
$ rustc hello.rs
$ ./hello # on a *NIX
$ .\hello.exe # on Windows
```

Note that we only ever pass `rustc` the *crate root*, not every file we wish
to compile. For example, if we had a `main.rs` that looked like this:

```
mod foo;

fn main() {
    foo::hello();
}
```

And a `foo.rs` that had this:

```
pub fn hello() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

To compile this, we'd run this command:

```
$ rustc main.rs
```

No need to tell `rustc` about `foo.rs`; the `mod` statements give it
everything that it needs. This is different than how you would use a C
compiler, where you invoke the compiler on each file, and then link
everything together. In other words, the *crate* is a translation unit, not a
particular module.
