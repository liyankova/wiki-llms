This version of the text assumes you’re using Rust 1.85.0 (released 2025-02-17)
or later with `edition = "2024"` in the Cargo.toml file of all projects to
configure them to use Rust 2024 edition idioms. See the [“Installation” section
of Chapter 1](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) to install or update Rust.

The HTML format is available online at
<https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/>
and offline with installations of Rust made with `rustup`; run `rustup doc --book` to open.

Several community [translations](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-06-translation.html) are also available.

This text is available in [paperback and ebook format from No Starch
Press](https://nostarch.com/rust-programming-language-2nd-edition).
