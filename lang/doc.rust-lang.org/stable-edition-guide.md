# Introduction - The Rust Edition Guide

# [Introduction](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/edition-guide/#introduction)

Welcome to The Rust Edition Guide! "Editions" are Rust's way of introducing

In this guide, we'll discuss:

* What editions are
* Which changes are contained in each edition
* How to migrate your code from one edition to another
