# Advanced Functions and Closures - The Rust Programming Language

## [Advanced Functions and Closures](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-04-advanced-functions-and-closures.html#advanced-functions-and-closures)

This section explores some advanced features related to functions and closures,
including function pointers and returning closures.

### [Function Pointers](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-04-advanced-functions-and-closures.html#function-pointers)

We’ve talked about how to pass closures to functions; you can also pass regular
functions to functions! This technique is useful when you want to pass a
function you’ve already defined rather than defining a new closure. Functions
coerce to the type `fn` (with a lowercase *f*), not to be confused with the
`Fn` closure trait. The `fn` type is called a *function pointer*. Passing
functions with function pointers will allow you to use functions as arguments
to other functions.

The syntax for specifying that a parameter is a function pointer is similar to
that of closures, as shown in Listing 20-28, where we’ve defined a function
`add_one` that adds 1 to its parameter. The function `do_twice` takes two
parameters: a function pointer to any function that takes an `i32` parameter
and returns an `i32`, and one `i32` value. The `do_twice` function calls the
function `f` twice, passing it the `arg` value, then adds the two function call
results together. The `main` function calls `do_twice` with the arguments
`add_one` and `5`.

Filename: src/main.rs

```
```
fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

fn do_twice(f: fn(i32) -> i32, arg: i32) -> i32 {
    f(arg) + f(arg)
}

fn main() {
    let answer = do_twice(add_one, 5);

    println!("The answer is: {answer}");
}
```
```

[Listing 20-28](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-04-advanced-functions-and-closures.html#listing-20-28): Using the `fn` type to accept a function pointer as an argument

This code prints `The answer is: 12`. We specify that the parameter `f` in
`do_twice` is an `fn` that takes one parameter of type `i32` and returns an
`i32`. We can then call `f` in the body of `do_twice`. In `main`, we can pass
the function name `add_one` as the first argument to `do_twice`.

Unlike closures, `fn` is a type rather than a trait, so we specify `fn` as the
parameter type directly rather than declaring a generic type parameter with one
of the `Fn` traits as a trait bound.

Function pointers implement all three of the closure traits (`Fn`, `FnMut`, and
`FnOnce`), meaning you can always pass a function pointer as an argument for a
function that expects a closure. It’s best to write functions using a generic
type and one of the closure traits so your functions can accept either
functions or closures.

That said, one example of where you would want to only accept `fn` and not
closures is when interfacing with external code that doesn’t have closures: C
functions can accept functions as arguments, but C doesn’t have closures.

As an example of where you could use either a closure defined inline or a named
function, let’s look at a use of the `map` method provided by the `Iterator`
trait in the standard library. To use the `map` method to turn a vector of
numbers into a vector of strings, we could use a closure, as in Listing 20-29.

```
```
fn main() {
    let list_of_numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let list_of_strings: Vec<String> =
        list_of_numbers.iter().map(|i| i.to_string()).collect();
}
```
```

[Listing 20-29](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-04-advanced-functions-and-closures.html#listing-20-29): Using a closure with the `map` method to convert numbers to strings

Or we could name a function as the argument to `map` instead of the closure.
Listing 20-30 shows what this would look like.

```
```
fn main() {
    let list_of_numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let list_of_strings: Vec<String> =
        list_of_numbers.iter().map(ToString::to_string).collect();
}
```
```

[Listing 20-30](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-04-advanced-functions-and-closures.html#listing-20-30): Using the `String::to_string` function with the `map` method method to convert numbers to strings

Note that we must use the fully qualified syntax that we talked about in
[“Advanced Traits”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-02-advanced-traits.html#advanced-traits) because there are multiple
functions available named `to_string`.

Here, we’re using the `to_string` function defined in the `ToString` trait,
which the standard library has implemented for any type that implements
`Display`.

Recall from [“Enum Values”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-01-defining-an-enum.html#enum-values) in Chapter 6 that the
name of each enum variant that we define also becomes an initializer function.
We can use these initializer functions as function pointers that implement the
closure traits, which means we can specify the initializer functions as
arguments for methods that take closures, as seen in Listing 20-31.

```
```
fn main() {
    enum Status {
        Value(u32),
        Stop,
    }

    let list_of_statuses: Vec<Status> = (0u32..20).map(Status::Value).collect();
}
```
```

[Listing 20-31](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-04-advanced-functions-and-closures.html#listing-20-31): Using an enum initializer with the `map` method to create a `Status` instance from numbers

Here, we create `Status::Value` instances using each `u32` value in the range
that `map` is called on by using the initializer function of `Status::Value`.
Some people prefer this style and some people prefer to use closures. They
compile to the same code, so use whichever style is clearer to you.

### [Returning Closures](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-04-advanced-functions-and-closures.html#returning-closures)

Closures are represented by traits, which means you can’t return closures
directly. In most cases where you might want to return a trait, you can instead
use the concrete type that implements the trait as the return value of the
function. However, you can’t usually do that with closures because they don’t
have a concrete type that is returnable; you’re not allowed to use the function
pointer `fn` as a return type if the closure captures any values from its
scope, for example.

Instead, you will normally use the `impl Trait` syntax we learned about in
Chapter 10. You can return any function type, using `Fn`, `FnOnce` and `FnMut`.
For example, the code in Listing 20-32 will compile just fine.

```
```
#![allow(unused)]
fn main() {
fn returns_closure() -> impl Fn(i32) -> i32 {
    |x| x + 1
}
}
```
```

[Listing 20-32](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-04-advanced-functions-and-closures.html#listing-20-32): Returning a closure from a function using the `impl Trait` syntax

However, as we noted in [“Closure Type Inference and
Annotation”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-01-closures.html#closure-type-inference-and-annotation) in Chapter 13, each closure is also
its own distinct type. If you need to work with multiple functions that have the
same signature but different implementations, you will need to use a trait
object for them. Consider what happens if you write code like that shown in
Listing 20-33.

Filename: src/main.rs

```
fn main() {
    let handlers = vec![returns_closure(), returns_initialized_closure(123)];
    for handler in handlers {
        let output = handler(5);
        println!("{output}");
    }
}

fn returns_closure() -> impl Fn(i32) -> i32 {
    |x| x + 1
}

fn returns_initialized_closure(init: i32) -> impl Fn(i32) -> i32 {
    move |x| x + init
}
```

[Listing 20-33](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-04-advanced-functions-and-closures.html#listing-20-33): Creating a `Vec<T>` of closures defined by functions that return `impl Fn` types

Here we have two functions, `returns_closure` and `returns_initialized_closure`,
which both return `impl Fn(i32) -> i32`. Notice that the closures that they
return are different, even though they implement the same type. If we try to
compile this, Rust lets us know that it won’t work:

```
$ cargo build

```

The error message tells us that whenever we return an `impl Trait`, Rust
creates a unique *opaque type*, a type where we cannot see into the details of
what Rust constructs for us, nor can we guess the type Rust will generate to
write ourselves. So even though these functions return closures that implement
the same trait, `Fn(i32) -> i32`, the opaque types Rust generates for each are
distinct. (This is similar to how Rust produces different concrete types for
distinct async blocks even when they have the same output type, as we saw in
[“Working with Any Number of Futures”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch17-03-more-futures.html) in
Chapter 17.) We have seen a solution to this problem a few times now: we can
use a trait object, as in Listing 20-34.

```
```
fn main() {
    let handlers = vec![returns_closure(), returns_initialized_closure(123)];
    for handler in handlers {
        let output = handler(5);
        println!("{output}");
    }
}

fn returns_closure() -> Box<dyn Fn(i32) -> i32> {
    Box::new(|x| x + 1)
}

fn returns_initialized_closure(init: i32) -> Box<dyn Fn(i32) -> i32> {
    Box::new(move |x| x + init)
}
```
```

This code will compile just fine. For more about trait objects, refer to the
section [“Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Different
Types”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-02-trait-objects.html#using-trait-objects-to-abstract-over-shared-behavior) in Chapter 18.

Next, let’s look at macros!
