To install the latest version Nix, run the following command:

```
$ curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
```

This performs the default type of installation for your platform:

* [Multi-user](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/installation/installing-binary#multi-user-installation):
  + Linux with systemd and without SELinux
  + macOS
* [Single-user](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/installation/installing-binary#single-user-installation):
  + Linux without systemd
  + Linux with SELinux

We recommend the multi-user installation if it supports your platform and you can authenticate with `sudo`.

The installer can be configured with various command line arguments and environment variables.
To show available command line flags:

```
$ curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh -s -- --help
```

To check what it does and how it can be customised further, [download and edit the second-stage installation script](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/installation/installing-binary#installing-from-a-binary-tarball).

# [Installing a pinned Nix version from a URL](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/installation/installing-binary#installing-a-pinned-nix-version-from-a-url)

Version-specific installation URLs for all Nix versions since 1.11.16 can be found at [releases.nixos.org](https://releases.nixos.org/?prefix=nix/).
The directory for each version contains the corresponding SHA-256 hash.

All installation scripts are invoked the same way:

```
$ export VERSION=2.19.2 
$ curl -L https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix-$VERSION/install | sh
```

# [Multi User Installation](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/installation/installing-binary#multi-user-installation)

The multi-user Nix installation creates system users and a system service for the Nix daemon.

Supported systems:

* Linux running systemd, with SELinux disabled
* macOS

To explicitly instruct the installer to perform a multi-user installation on your system:

```
$ bash <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --daemon
```

You can run this under your usual user account or `root`.
The script will invoke `sudo` as needed.

# [Single User Installation](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/installation/installing-binary#single-user-installation)

To explicitly select a single-user installation on your system:

```
$ bash <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install) --no-daemon
```

In a single-user installation, `/nix` is owned by the invoking user.
The script will invoke `sudo` to create `/nix` if it doesn’t already exist.
If you don’t have `sudo`, manually create `/nix` as `root`:

```
$ su root
# mkdir /nix
# chown alice /nix
```

# [Installing from a binary tarball](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/installation/installing-binary#installing-from-a-binary-tarball)

You can also download a binary tarball that contains Nix and all its dependencies:

* Choose a [version](https://releases.nixos.org/?prefix=nix/) and [system type](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/development/building#platforms)
* Download and unpack the tarball
* Run the installer

> **Example**
>
> ```
> $ pushd $(mktemp -d)
> $ export VERSION=2.19.2
> $ export SYSTEM=x86_64-linux
> $ curl -LO https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix-$VERSION/nix-$VERSION-$SYSTEM.tar.xz
> $ tar xfj nix-$VERSION-$SYSTEM.tar.xz
> $ cd nix-$VERSION-$SYSTEM
> $ ./install
> $ popd
> ```

The installer can be customised with the environment variables declared in the file named `install-multi-user`.

## [Native packages for Linux distributions](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/installation/installing-binary#native-packages-for-linux-distributions)

The Nix community maintains installers for some Linux distributions in their native packaging format(https://nix-community.github.io/nix-installers/).

# [macOS Installation](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/installation/installing-binary#macos-installation)

We believe we have ironed out how to cleanly support the read-only root file system
on modern macOS. New installs will do this automatically.

This section previously detailed the situation, options, and trade-offs,
but it now only outlines what the installer does. You don't need to know
this to run the installer, but it may help if you run into trouble:

* create a new APFS volume for your Nix store
* update `/etc/synthetic.conf` to direct macOS to create a "synthetic"
  empty root directory to mount your volume
* specify mount options for the volume in `/etc/fstab`
  + `rw`: read-write
  + `noauto`: prevent the system from auto-mounting the volume (so the
    LaunchDaemon mentioned below can control mounting it, and to avoid
    masking problems with that mounting service).
  + `nobrowse`: prevent the Nix Store volume from showing up on your
    desktop; also keeps Spotlight from spending resources to index
    this volume
* if you have FileVault enabled
  + generate an encryption password
  + put it in your system Keychain
  + use it to encrypt the volume
* create a system LaunchDaemon to mount this volume early enough in the
  boot process to avoid problems loading or restoring any programs that
  need access to your Nix store
