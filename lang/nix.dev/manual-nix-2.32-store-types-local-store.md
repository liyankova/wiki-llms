# Local Store - Nix 2.32.2 Reference Manual

# [Local Store](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/store/types/local-store#local-store)

**Store URL format**: `local`, *root*

This store type accesses a Nix store in the local filesystem directly
(i.e. not via the Nix daemon). *root* is an absolute path that is
prefixed to other directories such as the Nix store directory. The
store pseudo-URL `local` denotes a store that uses `/` as its root
directory.

A store that uses a *root* other than `/` is called a *chroot
store*. With such stores, the store directory is "logically" still
`/nix/store`, so programs stored in them can only be built and
executed by `chroot`-ing into *root*. Chroot stores only support
building and running on Linux when [`mount namespaces`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mount_namespaces.7.html) and [`user namespaces`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/user_namespaces.7.html) are
enabled.

For example, the following uses `/tmp/root` as the chroot environment
to build or download `nixpkgs#hello` and then execute it:

```
# nix run --store /tmp/root nixpkgs#hello
Hello, world!
```

Here, the "physical" store location is `/tmp/root/nix/store`, and
Nix's store metadata is in `/tmp/root/nix/var/nix/db`.

It is also possible, but not recommended, to change the "logical"
location of the Nix store from its default of `/nix/store`. This makes
it impossible to use default substituters such as
`https://cache.nixos.org/`, and thus you may have to build everything
locally. Here is an example:

```
# nix build --store 'local?store=/tmp/my-nix/store&state=/tmp/my-nix/state&log=/tmp/my-nix/log' nixpkgs#hello
```

## [Settings](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/store/types/local-store#settings)

* [`build-dir`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/store/types/local-store#store-local-store-build-dir)

  The directory on the host, in which derivations' temporary build directories are created.

  If not set, Nix will use the `builds` subdirectory of its configured state directory.

  Note that builds are often performed by the Nix daemon, so its `build-dir` applies.

  Nix will create this directory automatically with suitable permissions if it does not exist.
  Otherwise its permissions must allow all users to traverse the directory (i.e. it must have `o+x` set, in unix parlance) for non-sandboxed builds to work correctly.

  This is also the location where [`--keep-failed`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/command-ref/opt-common#opt-keep-failed) leaves its files.

  If Nix runs without sandbox, or if the platform does not support sandboxing with bind mounts (e.g. macOS), then the [`builder`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/language/derivations#attr-builder)'s environment will contain this directory, instead of the virtual location [`sandbox-build-dir`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/store/types/local-store#conf-sandbox-build-dir).

  > **Warning**
  >
  > `build-dir` must not be set to a world-writable directory.
  > Placing temporary build directories in a world-writable place allows other users to access or modify build data that is currently in use.
  > This alone is merely an impurity, but combined with another factor this has allowed malicious derivations to escape the build sandbox.

  **Default:** ``
* [`log`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/store/types/local-store#store-local-store-log)

  directory where Nix stores log files.

  **Default:** `/nix/var/log/nix`
* [`path-info-cache-size`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/store/types/local-store#store-local-store-path-info-cache-size)

  Size of the in-memory store path metadata cache.

  **Default:** `65536`
* [`priority`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/store/types/local-store#store-local-store-priority)

  Priority of this store when used as a [substituter](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/command-ref/conf-file#conf-substituters).
  A lower value means a higher priority.

  **Default:** `0`
* [`read-only`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/store/types/local-store#store-local-store-read-only)

  Allow this store to be opened when its [database](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/glossary#gloss-nix-database) is on a read-only filesystem.

  Normally Nix attempts to open the store database in read-write mode, even for querying (when write access is not needed), causing it to fail if the database is on a read-only filesystem.

  Enable read-only mode to disable locking and open the SQLite database with the [`immutable` parameter](https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/open.html) set.

  > **Warning**
  > Do not use this unless the filesystem is read-only.
  >
  > Using it when the filesystem is writable can cause incorrect query results or corruption errors if the database is changed by another process.
  > While the filesystem the database resides on might appear to be read-only, consider whether another user or system might have write access to it.

  **Default:** `false`
* [`real`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/store/types/local-store#store-local-store-real)

  Physical path of the Nix store.

  **Default:** `/nix/store`
* [`require-sigs`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/store/types/local-store#store-local-store-require-sigs)

  Whether store paths copied into this store should have a trusted signature.

  **Default:** `true`
* [`root`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/store/types/local-store#store-local-store-root)

  Directory prefixed to all other paths.

  **Default:** ``
* [`state`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/store/types/local-store#store-local-store-state)

  Directory where Nix stores state.

  **Default:** `/dummy`
* [`store`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/store/types/local-store#store-local-store-store)

  Logical location of the Nix store, usually
  `/nix/store`. Note that you can only copy store paths
  between stores if they have the same `store` setting.

  **Default:** `/nix/store`
* [`system-features`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/store/types/local-store#store-local-store-system-features)

  Optional [system features](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/command-ref/conf-file#conf-system-features) available on the system this store uses to build derivations.

  Example: `"kvm"`

  **Default:** *machine-specific*
* [`trusted`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/store/types/local-store#store-local-store-trusted)

  Whether paths from this store can be used as substitutes
  even if they are not signed by a key listed in the
  [`trusted-public-keys`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/command-ref/conf-file#conf-trusted-public-keys)
  setting.

  **Default:** `false`
* [`want-mass-query`](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/store/types/local-store#store-local-store-want-mass-query)

  Whether this store can be queried efficiently for path validity when used as a [substituter](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.32/command-ref/conf-file#conf-substituters).

  **Default:** `false`
