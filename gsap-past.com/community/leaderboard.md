   Circling back...
   I believe this may have been related to a very rare glitch which should be resolved in the latest horizontalLoop() helper function which you can find in this CodePen:
   https://codepen.io/GreenSock/pen/gOvvJee
   You can copy/paste that helper function into your project and see if it resolves things.

   ## [Stop optimising your code!](https://gsap.com/community/forums/topic/39906-stop-optimising-your-code/?do=findComment&comment=198678)

   Stop optimising your code before it is even working! I have to preface this with I do this all the time, but knowing helps me get out of this thought process.
   I see so many questions on this forum “how do I do this in a for loop, but then not for the third item in the loop…”, you're making it way to complex. I know we all have learned Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY), but there is nothing wrong with a little repeating if you know you're going to optimise it later.
   When I feel I’m banging my head against the wall and can’t see how the get something to loop the way I want, I take a step back and just manually write it out by hand. Literally writing out what each element should do, this of course can be insane if you need to have more then a hundred elements to do something, but then I just pick the first few, eg .item:nth-child(1), .item:nth-child(2), … .item:nth-child(5),ect. If you do this a few times you’ll probably see a pattern emerging, but try to resist the urge to start optimising, just keep writing out the animation until you have a solid base that represents the animation you want to have.
   That is why I love working in Codepen, first I don't have to worry about my real projects dependancies, or my framework throwing weird errors, I can just worry about the demo I’m building and making it the best I can and when I think I’m ready for the next step I fork my pen and start moving the code around. Get some of the repeating code and try adding it to a for loop, then test if it is still doing what it was doing when it was written out by hand.
   Below some code examples from a real world project of mine, where I was “I don't even know how this would work!” and you can see my first demo was no where finished, I had over a hundred lines of animation code!
   https://codepen.io/mvaneijgen/pen/YzgVKRo
   Then I forked the first version and started to optimise a few things, swapping out fixed values for dynamic once, but still going on writing each tween out by hand, there even more lines of code now!
   https://codepen.io/mvaneijgen/pen/gOEWYZp
   In version 3 I finally found that I had the animation down like I want it, it could still use some fine tuning, but all the logic was there. Two hundred lines of code!
   https://codepen.io/mvaneijgen/pen/dyrRrvL
   And finally reducing that amount of code to just fifty lines by optimising what was already working and removing the duplicated code and adding it to a for loop.
   This is just an example, it might not even be the final code, but it is working! So now I can worry about accessibility making it responsive and making it fancy. But it's to illustrate that I could never come to the same conclusion that I’ve come to now if I had started with trying to optimise the code from the start. Personally I need to get a feel for what the code needs to do. Working in Codepen and forking your work is such a life saver, because you can fall back at earlier versions when you inevitably brake something, not to talk about GSDevTools what an awesome tool to debug an animation (? did you know you could just use that paid plugin, even if you’re not a member on Codepen for free!)
   If you can do this at your first go writing out a project, why are you even reading this?! And we love to have you helping around here on the forum, it is great to have such a keen eye help out!

   ## [Display issue with sticky elements in conjunction with right-side scrolling](https://gsap.com/community/forums/topic/45164-display-issue-with-sticky-elements-in-conjunction-with-right-side-scrolling/?do=findComment&comment=220733)

   Hi @lzyoo welcome to the forum!
   When working with ScrollTrigger you should have it handle all pinning, so you should not use position: sticky; but in your ScrollTrigger which needs to be sticky set pin: true, this way ScrollTrigger knows what needs to stick and adjust all the calculation based on that.
   You should also really pay close attention to adding transitions (see transition: transform 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.5, 0, 0.5, 1); in your .layer class) to elements that GSAP is animation, please read https://gsap.com/resources/mistakes/#using-css-transitions-and-gsap-on-the-same-properties
   The best thing to do when working with ScrollTrigger is to remove it! This seems counter intuitive, but ScrollTrigger is just animating something on scroll, so just focus on the animation at first and only when you're happy with the animation add ScrollTrigger back in. This way you can focus on one part at a time and it will save a lot of headache when debugging.
   Most of the ScrollTrigger effects you see are just moving things on the y-axis instead of scrolling them, then hooking that animation to ScrollTrigger will give the illusion of scrolling, but they are really just animating! Getting to grips with this knowledge will make it so much easier to create all kinds of effects, I've written a whole post about it, check it out:
   If you can you should stay away from animating top, left, right, bottom and use the transform properties instead y and x, these are much better for performance!
   I've changed your CSS a bit and have all cards start at the same position and then move them .from() off screen to on screen. I've also disabled ScrollTrigger as mentioned above to really focus on the animation at first and take it one step at a time. I think my topic above would really help you understand the logic and how to set everything up.
   https://codepen.io/mvaneijgen/pen/emJoqdb?editors=0010
   If you still need help after this be sure to post back here, show us what you've tried and someone here will surely point you in the right direction.
   Hope it helps and happy tweening!

   I don't have much time to look at this, but it sounds like it could be related to this which is a Firefox bug they introduced related to fill="none" (I'd recommend changing it to transparent instead of none) but we've got a workaround implemented in our next release:

   ## [ScrollTrigger + CSS scroll-behavior alternatives](https://gsap.com/community/forums/topic/45221-scrolltrigger-css-scroll-behavior-alternatives/?do=findComment&comment=220951)

   Hi @wooooo welcome to the forum!
   Yes indeed setting scroll-behavior: smooth, is like setting CSS transitions on the same property GSAP is animating. Everything will feel sluggish and takes a lot more time to complete than initially set.
   I always gravitate to scrollTo, just catch all links with a hash (#) in them an then use scrollTo to animate to the point you want with what animation speed and offset set ect.
   I also made a post how you can scroll to specific points inside a ScrollTrigger, see my post below. Also check out the comment by @GreenSock they made some really cool helper functions.
   I think this would also work, but you need to reverse your logic. Have scroll-behavior: none set by default and then when someone clicks a anchor link quickly set scroll-behavior: smooth I think then still if you 'scroll' past an ScrollTrigger it can screw things up, but you can always try.
   Hope it helps and happy tweening!

    ## [Three tracks animation](https://gsap.com/community/forums/topic/45218-three-tracks-animation/?do=findComment&comment=220939)

    Yeah seems totally doable with GSAP, probably want to look in to the MotionPath plugin https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/MotionPathPlugin/
    I would build the animation at first hand using a timeline and then .play() .reverse() .pause(), ect these timelines, so that you don't create the animation from scratch each time you click.
    What have you tried already? We love to see what you can come up with, that way we can see your thought process and thus better help you understand the tools!

    ## [How do I update the Height value?](https://gsap.com/community/forums/topic/45216-how-do-i-update-the-height-value/?do=findComment&comment=220935)

    Hi,
    The main problem here resides in the fact that GSAP, for optimization reasons, stores the initial value of the property being animated to prevent constant read/write operations which could become really expensive and create performance issues. That's why you see the jump, because GSAP is actually reversing from the value the GSAP instance has, not the current value of the element's property.
    One alternative could be to create the animation on each click event. I doubt there would be a perceivable performance issue, you can even store the scroll height value of each element up front to prevent getting it each time you open an element. Like that you tell GSAP to tween the height to 0 or the scroll height value on every event, which means GSAP will use a new set of values each time. Something like this:
    https://codepen.io/GreenSock/pen/JoXpEPK
    Of course there is no collapsing of nested elements in this demo because that will require some custom logic that you already seem to have in place, but is a solid proof of concept on how to tackle this.
    Hopefully this helps
    Happy Tweening!

Getting to grips with this knowledge will make it so much easier to create all kinds of effects, I've written a whole post about it, check it out:
    I find the way this tutorial is setup a bit complicated and also note that GSAP has its own smooth scroll library called ScrollSmoother https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/ScrollSmoother/ which works out of the box with all the GSAP tools, so I don't see why you would use lenis (but to each their own)
    How I would set it up is just build the animation you want (in a timeline) and then hook that to ScrollTrigger when you think it is done to see how that works on scroll. Below your pen with ScrollTrigger removed as mentioned above and GSDevTools installed so that you can easily debug your animation.
    https://codepen.io/mvaneijgen/pen/QwNaRdr?editors=1010
    If you're new to GSAP check out this awesome getting started guide https://gsap.com/resources/get-started/
    Again how the tutorials is made is not how I personally would set it up, not that it is bad, but different preferences. If it must work like the tutorials I would ask the original creator, seems like they are also selling the source code, so that is the route I would go down.
    Hope it helps and happy tweening!

    ## [How to use GSAP for smooth UI transitions in script/executor dashboards?](https://gsap.com/community/forums/topic/45193-how-to-use-gsap-for-smooth-ui-transitions-in-scriptexecutor-dashboards/?do=findComment&comment=220853)

    Hi @Aaron Giorz welcome to the forum!
    What have you tried already? We love to see what you can come up with, that way we can see your thought process and thus better help you understand the tools!
    If you're new to GSAP check out this awesome getting started guide https://gsap.com/resources/get-started/
    There isn't really a "hear you go" solution, it all depends on your stack and overall layout setup. For example I often use Vue.js which has simple hooks for unloading an loading content, eg beforeUnmount, Unmounted, beforeMount and mounted I can then load GSAP in these hooks and set their state to what I want them to be and then start animating when everything has loaded, but each framework or even setup in a specific framework is different, but I would figure what ever you're using it will have similar hooks even the new View Transitions work in these ways.
    Personally I always start with all my animations on a place like Codepen, just to test my animation in its basic form with pure HTML, CSS and JS to make sure my animation is working as expected and not my framework is trowing errors. This also makes it really easy to debug, because you have a known working version and next to that you can easily share a version on places like this to ask for feedback when you get stuck.
    Hope it helps and happy tweening!

    Sorry about any confusion there. It sounds like you're using a very strict setting in TypeScript that won't allow "any" types. I have attached some updated TypeScript files for CustomEase, CustomWiggle, and CustomBounce. You can just replace those files in the gsap "types" folder. They'll be in the next official release too of course. Do those work better for you?

    By default, GSAP will auto-round pixel values for CSS properties like the ones you're animating (snaps to whole numbers). You can disable this with autoRound: false:

    Hi @ChengCheng\_0v0 welcome to the forum!
    There are some properties you're better off not animating, top, left, bottom, right, width, height, margin and padding are a few of those. These can cause browser repaints and that is to be avoided at all cost, because that will introduce the jittering you're talking about.
    For this particular effect I would create the animation with the Flip plugin, check it out https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/Flip/
    This demo from the collection page might help you get started. Hope it helps and happy tweening!

    Looks cool! I would say just do it!
    I find that you can’t really understand the “conceptual structure” until you start laying things out.
    it usually takes me around 10 versions to get something I’m happy with (and I’ve been coding for years), so I would say, just start, codepen is a great place for this!

    ## [ScrollSmoother conflicting with Tween](https://gsap.com/community/forums/topic/45172-scrollsmoother-conflicting-with-tween/?do=findComment&comment=220775)

    You're creating conflicting tweens, eg you have two separate tools (ScrollSmoother and a GSAP tween both animate the y propety)that try to animate the same object and the same property, see https://gsap.com/resources/conflict.
    You either have to wrap your element in another element (see below) or use different properties. In this case this could work, seen that you are using y but are using percent values, then you can better use yPercent: 140 instead of y: "140%". Aso note that instead of a .set() and a .to() you can also leave out the .set() end use a .from() instead, saves you a lot of typing!
    Hope it helps and happy tweening!

    ## [SVG Draw - Lines changing width](https://gsap.com/community/forums/topic/45160-svg-draw-lines-changing-width/?do=findComment&comment=220730)

    Hi,
    I made some simple paths with a vector software (I use Inkscape) with a cubic bezier, it might not be exactly what you're looking for, but the main idea is to use bezier commands instead of an arc ellipse:

    Hopefully this helps

    ## [Masking is not align with the high speed scroll.](https://gsap.com/community/forums/topic/45157-masking-is-not-align-with-the-high-speed-scroll/?do=findComment&comment=220727)

    Hi,
    As Jack mentions this is due to to the scale value you're applying, because of that at some point the scale keeps growing as you scroll but the text already covered the entire screen so the animation keeps going even though is not perceptible. The solutions are to use a smaller value in combination with some translate or use a larger end value in ScrollTrigger.
    I updated our demo:
    https://codepen.io/GreenSock/pen/QwyZryj
    Finally I would strongly recommend you to check this thread by @mvaneijgen on the subject:
    Happy Tweening!

    Yeah I strongly recommend you to use Stackblitz instead of codepen for React demos. You can fork this starter template and make the changes you need:
    https://stackblitz.com/edit/gsap-react-basic-f48716
    Also is better to add a new post to the thread, because we don't get notifications when you edit/update a post, so the best way to ensure that we will look into this thread is to add a new post.

    ## [ScrollTrigger: multiple start/stop sections](https://gsap.com/community/forums/topic/45153-scrolltrigger-multiple-startstop-sections/?do=findComment&comment=220691)

    Hi @fitzel welcome to the forum!
    Just FYI GSAP isn't open source, it is free but that doesn't mean open source.
    The best thing to do when working with ScrollTrigger is to remove it! This seems counter intuitive, but ScrollTrigger is just animating something on scroll, so just focus on the animation at first and only when you're happy with the animation add ScrollTrigger back in. This way you can focus on one part at a time and it will save a lot of headache when debugging.
    Most of the ScrollTrigger effects you see are just moving things on the y-axis instead of scrolling them, then hooking that animation to ScrollTrigger will give the illusion of scrolling, but they are really just animating! Getting to grips with this knowledge will make it so much easier to create all kinds of effects, I've written a whole post about it, check it out:
    This demo from the collection page might help. Each card has its on animation, but as you can see it is all contained in one big timeline, which I find is the easiest way of going about this. Hope it helps and happy tweening!

    Hi there,
    I'm new to GSAP and new to development in general, I'm coming from Webflow as a designer.
    Anyhow, I've been trying to make - as the title states - a carousel/slider with all the features I want for UX purposes. I intend on reusing this code on future projects.
    I the features I set out to achieve are:
    Smooth motion
    Draggable for mobile mainly
    Clickable for desktop mainly
    Infinite scrolling
    I have made something that works the way I want using the Infinite Scrolling helper function from the GSAP Docs page and added my own alterations, but I am not sure if this is how it is supposed to be done, since I started with an existing function I might have accidentally "doubled down" on the wrong solution, I would love some pointers to the right direction.
    I've attached a demo here so everyone can see what I'm trying to get at, it's quite a specific thing I'm looking for so it's really hard to find good information.
    P.S. I'm very new to coding in general, I absolutely am not expecting a full-on tutorial or anything but even some pointers to like "hey learn this one first" would be appreciated, I'm also not at the stage to fully commit to pure code and will be utilizing a lot of Webflow in the foreseeable future hope this add all the necessary context.
    Thank you everyone in advance.

    @mvaneijgen @Rodrigo Thanks guys, I've thrown myself down the rabbit hole with GSAP/js animating in general, it's been awesome, the documentation was very helpful. I've just been a bit too cautious and spending so much time worrying that I was going to end up writing something so atrocious it was gonna crash as soon as it goes live haha 😅. Will be adopting a more "if it works it works" mentality. Thanks for the time to help out a newbie!

    Hi @willdoforabigmac welcome to the forum!
    Seems good to me, if it works it works! The seamless loop helper function is great! I also use it often and have year of experience with GSAP and wouldn't want to build it my self! It is just robust and well thought out.
    If you want to get serious with GSAP I would just start with our getting started guidehttps://gsap.com/resources/get-started/ and open up a Codepen and take it from there. Just start building some simple things that you might want to use and take it from there. Then when you get stuck open up the docs or the forum to see if you can figure out what you're missing and when you get stuck just post back here with what you've tried and someone here will surely point you in the right direction.
    Hope it helps and happy tweening!

    Hello @Its\_Lefty
    To get that non pin-spacing-showing type of pinning, you could wrap your content in a div and pin that wrapping div instead.
    In the demo below I wrapped all of the content, but you could also just wrap the parts that might be visible at any point.
    [...and now after I wrote that, I realize that this is pretty much what Blake already pointed you to ?]
    Beware though: For any subsequent ScrollTriggers within that same wrapper/pin-spacer you will want to set the pinnedContainer property to have their starts/ends where you'd expect them to be.
    I hope that helps. Happy scrolling!

    ## [Add some parallax effect threejs](https://gsap.com/community/forums/topic/28371-add-some-parallax-effect-threejs/?do=findComment&comment=140445)

    ? Well, I'm also not sure what the desired outcome is here.
    But since you are moving things in a 3-dimensional space and using the PerspectiveCamera here, there is no need to 'apply' a parallax effect in any special way between different 3D elements - it is already there. If you'd want it to feel parallax(ish) in relation to the background, I guess you'd just have to make sure that your elements move faster than the background does.
    In the end what exactly you want to achieve comes down to camera positioning and movement of either the elements or the camera ( one might be better suited than the other, depending on what you want to do, I guess).
    Here is an example with ScrollTrigger's smoothScroll() helper-function included for the smooth-scrolling effect (first example pen on the .scrollerProxy() documentation page). Maybe that helps get in the right direction
