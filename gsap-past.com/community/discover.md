   Jack Bug posted a topic in [GSAP](https://gsap.com/community/forums/forum/11-gsap/)

   Hi Team,
   Currently I'm figuring out GSAP features in React and curious how to make a gallery page that can do like this image (attached):
   - XY Axis scroll and draggable
   - Infinite content
   - Smooth (Inertia??)
   When I try to make it with my own, it's not really infinite content and lagging, then the XY Axis not flexible to scroll and draggable (I haven't figure it out until the smooth one). Does anyone can help me to make this kind as an example?
   Reference:

    Hola @Rodrigo sorry for the absence and thanks a lot for the documentation — it really helped me achieve the effect I have so far in the CodePen. The element is already reacting to the mouse, but I’m still missing that animation where the SVG or the path gets that 3D/perspective feel.
    Could you please help me with that? Thanks a lot!

    Hi @Shreyas Sihasane and welcome to the GSAP Forums!
    The code in the demo Cassie posted is just javascript, Typescript is just javascript with type checking/definitions, nothing more.
    You should start by creating the demo in React in JS, basically the same JS code will be enough, then you can port it to Typescript, which shouldn't be too hard, although I'm far from being a typescript expert.
    The first step should be to check how to use GSAP in React with our useGSAP hook:
    https://gsap.com/resources/React
    Then just start working on porting the JS code to a React project, which shouldn't be too complicated.
    Finally we have these demos that show how to implement our useGSAP in React projects:
    https://stackblitz.com/@GSAP-dev/collections/gsap-react-starters
    Hopefully this helps
    Happy Tweening!

    Hi,
    If I understand correctly what you're trying to do, you need to keep using pinSpacing: false but manually create the pin space required to run the animation in the current section before the next one stacks over it.
    These demos show that approach:

    The best thing to do when working with ScrollTrigger is to remove it! This seems counter intuitive, but ScrollTrigger is just animating something on scroll, so just focus on the animation at first and only when you're happy with the animation add ScrollTrigger back in. This way you can focus on one part at a time and it will save a lot of headache when debugging.
    Most of the ScrollTrigger effects you see are just moving things on the y-axis instead of scrolling them, then hooking that animation to ScrollTrigger will give the illusion of scrolling, but they are really just animating! Getting to grips with this knowledge will make it so much easier to create all kinds of effects, I've written a whole post about it, check it out:
    Currently you create a ScrollTrigger and animation for each card it then needs to pin (this reparents each element and that is probably why you see the jerking motion). I find it much simpler to create just one ScrollTrigger and one timeline that controls everything, this even has the added benefit of creating an animation that does anything you want. Do you want to 3rd item to do a 360 spin, just add that to the timeline and you're golden!
    Below a pen of one of the collections in the post linked above, this has the same effect, but in one timeline, minus the scale, but that logic you can borrow from another pen in the post.
    Be sure to read through it, it goes over some key features what will allow you to create any effect in the future.
    https://codepen.io/mvaneijgen/pen/VYZBQpM?editors=0010
    Your original solution would work, but this will need some CSS/HTML fixed to prevent the jump from happening and this will be hard to find seen that you obfuscate your CSS through tailwind, so personally I wouldn't even know where to start debugging this.
    Hope it helps and happy tweening!

    I’m working on a small Vite + React demo, and I’m noticing that the cards on the right side “jerk” or shift slightly whenever the page scrolls. I’ve tried debugging the layout and styles but haven’t been able to identify the root cause.
    Here’s the demo:
    https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-ss3cs37a?file=src/my-component.tsx,src/main.tsx,src/App.tsx,vite.config.ts,src/index.css,index.html&terminal=dev
    I’d appreciate any help identifying why this happens and how to fix it.

    Yeah i was making exactly this way. First making an animations inside of separate components then added the scroll trigger inside of them and then adding the scroll trigger to parent component and then i encountered the real problems.
    Now my real question is if this that i want to make is even possible in a way i want to do it.
    Now by your examples i got an idea that maybe i would make a wrapper that have like 100vw and 100vh with overflow hidden. then i would make an illusion of scrolling by translating the components from Y 100% to Y 0 to make pretty much same effect that i want to make.
    Thanks for guidelines.
    Will try to get something out of it.

    Hello
    I have a problem with my scroll trigger animations. i want to make a pin panel animation that would stack my page\_sections. and inside of each page section there will be scroll trigger with its own animation.
    i made this far that if in my Home component enable pin spacing on true the animations work but the panels are not stacking like if pinSpacing is false.
    But i cant figure out how to make it work that i would pin the element and make the animation like:
    hero anim -> 1 parallax section -> hotspot anim -> 2 parallax section -> and so on...
    now i am getting
    hero anim and 1 paralax section at the same time. and then hotspot anim and 2 paralax section at the same time.
    and because of that not all animations are seen.

    Hi @wooooo welcome to the forum!
    Yes indeed setting scroll-behavior: smooth, is like setting CSS transitions on the same property GSAP is animating. Everything will feel sluggish and takes a lot more time to complete than initially set.
    I always gravitate to scrollTo, just catch all links with a hash (#) in them an then use scrollTo to animate to the point you want with what animation speed and offset set ect.
    I also made a post how you can scroll to specific points inside a ScrollTrigger, see my post below. Also check out the comment by @GreenSock they made some really cool helper functions.
    I think this would also work, but you need to reverse your logic. Have scroll-behavior: none set by default and then when someone clicks a anchor link quickly set scroll-behavior: smooth I think then still if you 'scroll' past an ScrollTrigger it can screw things up, but you can always try.
    Hope it helps and happy tweening!

    Hi, when combining ScrollTrigger with CSS scroll-behavior, the ScrollTrigger is not refreshing properly on resize when animation is happening halfway. Did some research and realized it's conflicting with CSS scroll-behavior: smooth. However i needed that CSS since I have navigation link that anchor other sections on the same page. Adding ScrollTrigger.normalizeScroll(true); is just disabling the scroll-behavior in CSS
    Also tried adding but doesnt work
    ScrollTrigger.addEventListener("refreshInit", function () {
    // remove html scroll-behavior to prevent jumpy behavior during refresh
    // this code will run BEFORE the refresh
    document.documentElement.style.scrollBehavior = "auto";
    });
    ScrollTrigger.addEventListener("refresh", function () {
    // this code will run AFTER all ScrollTriggers refreshed.
    document.documentElement.style.scrollBehavior = "smooth";
    });
    Any alternatives? I'm thinking of using GSAP ScrollTo plugin instead of relying on CSS. But are there any better ideas?
    Thanks

    Yeah seems totally doable with GSAP, probably want to look in to the MotionPath plugin https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/MotionPathPlugin/
    I would build the animation at first hand using a timeline and then .play() .reverse() .pause(), ect these timelines, so that you don't create the animation from scratch each time you click.
    What have you tried already? We love to see what you can come up with, that way we can see your thought process and thus better help you understand the tools!
    Here is a starter template which loads all the plugins

    Hope it helps and happy tweening!

    Hi All, I’m trying to create a similar route animation https://tinyurl.com/rnbk953d.
    Please check how it has that smooth interface where you can click on the three tracks.
    Is there any possibility to create a similar one using GSAP? I want the interaction to feel a bit more dynamic.

    Hi,
    The main problem here resides in the fact that GSAP, for optimization reasons, stores the initial value of the property being animated to prevent constant read/write operations which could become really expensive and create performance issues. That's why you see the jump, because GSAP is actually reversing from the value the GSAP instance has, not the current value of the element's property.
    One alternative could be to create the animation on each click event. I doubt there would be a perceivable performance issue, you can even store the scroll height value of each element up front to prevent getting it each time you open an element. Like that you tell GSAP to tween the height to 0 or the scroll height value on every event, which means GSAP will use a new set of values each time. Something like this:
    https://codepen.io/GreenSock/pen/JoXpEPK
    Of course there is no collapsing of nested elements in this demo because that will require some custom logic that you already seem to have in place, but is a solid proof of concept on how to tackle this.
    Hopefully this helps
    Happy Tweening!
