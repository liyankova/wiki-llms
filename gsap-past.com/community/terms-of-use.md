### I. DEFINITIONS

* **“GSAP License”** means the terms and conditions of this GSAP Software License Agreement.
* **"GSAP Products"** means any Software made available at [gsap.com](https://gsap.com) or any successor sites, including but not limited to the GSAP animation library and related plugins, tools, or extensions.
* **"Permitted Uses"** means the implementation and/or use of GSAP Products on any website, web application, or digital interface by any person or entity (which may include, for clarity, those of companies that compete with Webflow in other areas of business).
* **"Prohibited Uses"** means any implementation and/or use of GSAP Products in tools that allow users to build visual animations without code that encourages, induces, or materially assists in creating a solution that competes with Webflow’s visual animation building capabilities.
* **"Competitive Products"** means any software, tool, or service that enables users to create, edit, or manage animations through a visual interface or builder similar to [Webflow](https://webflow.com).

You may not:

1. Use any GSAP Products for any Prohibited Uses without prior written consent;

### VI. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

1. **General**: This GSAP License is incorporated into and subject to Webflow’s Terms of Service available [here](https://webflow.com/legal/terms) (**"Terms of Service"**). In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this GSAP License and the Terms of Service, the terms of this GSAP License shall govern in relation to your use of any GSAP Products.
2. **Amendments**: Webflow reserves the right to update or modify this GSAP License at any time by posting the revised terms on this website, provided that any such updates or modifications shall not result in any material degradation to the security, integrity, or functionality of any GSAP Products. You understand and agree that your continued use of any GSAP Products after such revisions to this GSAP License constitutes your acceptance of this GSAP License as revised. If you do not accept the revised GSAP License, you are prohibited from using versions of the GSAP Products released after the effective date of the revised GSAP License (as well as any updates made to previous versions). Notwithstanding, you may continue using previous versions of GSAP Products under the applicable terms licensed to you prior to the effective date of the revised GSAP License (for clarity, excluding any updates made thereto).
3. **No Waiver**: Failure of Webflow to enforce any provision of this GSAP License shall not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.

# FAQ

* **Is it acceptable for AI tools like ChatGPT, Cursor, Lovable, Webstudio, etc. to generate GSAP code?**
  Absolutely! AI-generated code is not a "Prohibited Use".
* **What if a WordPress plugin or theme or other niche tool allows users to create GSAP-driven effects through a visual interface? Is that prohibited?**
  We want to encourage developers to build on top of GSAP, including visual tools that don't directly compete with Webflow's rich animation-building capabilities. If you are not sure if your product might be considered a "Prohibited Use", feel free to [contact us](https://gsap.com/contact) so we can talk through it!
* **Can I really use GSAP in commercial projects without paying anything?**
  Yes, really! Commercial usage is covered under the standard license. All of GSAP including the plugins that were formerly "members-only" like [SplitText](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/SplitText/) and [MorphSVG](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/MorphSVGPlugin) can be used in commercial projects at no charge. Enjoy! 💚
