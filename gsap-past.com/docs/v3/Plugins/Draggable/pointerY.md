# pointerY

### pointerY : Number

[read-only] The y (vertical) position of the pointer (mouse or touch) associated with the Draggable's last event (like event.pageY).

### Details[​](#details "Direct link to Details")

*Number* - The `y` (vertical) position of the pointer (mouse or touch) associated with the Draggable's last event (like `event.pageY`). In most cases, this should be used instead of using the event's `.pageY` because GSAP tries to normalize positioning across all browsers.
