### autoScroll : Number

How fast to scroll the container element when `autoScroll` is `true`.

### Details[​](#details "Direct link to Details")

*Number* - To enable auto-scrolling when a Draggable is dragged within 40px of an edge of a scrollable container, set `autoScroll` to a non-zero value, where `1` is normal speed, `2` is double-speed, etc. (you can use any number). For a more intuitive or natural feel, it will scroll faster as the mouse/touch gets closer to the edge. The default value is `0` (no auto-scrolling).
