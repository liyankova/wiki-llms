# GSAP | GSAP | Docs & Learning

* GSAP

On this page

The `gsap` object serves as the access point for most of GSAP's functionality. It's just a generic object with various methods and properties that create and control [Tweens](/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween) and [Timelines](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline), two of the most important concepts to understand.

Quick Overview

For a quick overview of the GSAP object, check out this video from the ["GSAP 3 Express" course](https://courses.snorkl.tv/courses/gsap-3-express?ref=44f484) by Snorkl.tv - one of the best ways to learn the basics.

To get the most out of GSAP, it's crucial that you understand what Tweens and Timelines are:

### What's a Tween?[​](#whats-a-tween "Direct link to What's a Tween?")

A [Tween](/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween) is what does all the animation work - think of it like a **high-performance property setter**. You feed in targets (the objects you want to animate), a duration, and any properties you want it to animate and then when the Tween's playhead moves to a new position, figures out what the property values should be at that point applies them accordingly.

#### Common methods for creating a Tween:[​](#common-methods-for-creating-a-tween "Direct link to Common methods for creating a Tween:")

* [gsap.to()](/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.to())
* [gsap.from()](/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.from())
* [gsap.fromTo()](/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.fromTo())

For simple animations (no fancy sequencing), the methods above are all you need! For example:

```
//rotate and move elements with a class of "box" ("x" is a shortcut for a translateX() transform) over the course of 1 second.  
gsap.to(".box", { rotation: 27, x: 100, duration: 1 });
```

#### loading...

You can do basic sequencing by using the `delay` special property, but Timelines make sequencing and complex choreography much, much easier.

### What's a Timeline?[​](#whats-a-timeline "Direct link to What's a Timeline?")

A [Timeline](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline) is a **container for Tweens.** It's the ultimate sequencing tool that lets you position animations in time wherever you want and then control the whole sequence easily with methods like [pause()](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline/pause()), [play()](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline/play()), [progress()](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline/progress()), [reverse()](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline/reverse()), [timeScale()](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline/timeScale()), etc.

Create as many Timelines as you want. You can even **nest them** which is fantastic for modularizing your animation code! Every animation (Tween and Timeline) gets placed onto a parent timeline (the [globalTimeline](/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.globalTimeline()) by default). Moving a Timeline's playhead cascades down through its children so that the playheads stay aligned. A Timeline is purely about grouping things and coordinating time/playheads - it never actually sets properties on targets (Tweens handle that).

#### Method for creating a Timeline:[​](#method-for-creating-a-timeline "Direct link to Method for creating a Timeline:")

* [gsap.timeline()](/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.timeline())

GSAP's API lets you control virtually anything on-the-fly, such as the playhead position, the [startTime](/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween/startTime()) of any child, even play/pause/reverse the timeline or alter the timeScale itself.

## Sequencing[​](#sequencing "Direct link to Sequencing")

First, create a Timeline:

```
var tl = gsap.timeline();
```

Then add a tween using one of the convenience methods - [to()](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline/to()), [from()](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline/from()), or [fromTo()](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline/fromTo()):

```
tl.to(".box", { duration: 2, x: 100, opacity: 0.5 });
```

Do that as many times as you want. Notice we're calling `.to()` **on the timeline instance** (the variable `tl` in this case), not the `gsap` object. This creates a tween and immediately puts it into that particular Timeline. `gsap.to()`, on the other hand, creates a standalone tween. By default, the animations will be sequenced one-after-the-other. You can even use method chaining to simplify your code like this:

```
//sequenced one-after-the-other  
tl.to(".box1", { duration: 2, x: 100 }) //notice that there's no semicolon!  
  .to(".box2", { duration: 1, y: 200 })  
  .to(".box3", { duration: 3, rotation: 360 });
```

info

The whole GSAP platform is object-oriented and you could create individual tween instances with [gsap.to()](/docs/v3/GSAP/gsap.to()), for example, and then [timeline.add()](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline/add()) each one but it's just easier to call .to(), .from(), or .fromTo() directly on the Timeline instance to do the same thing in fewer steps.

## Positioning[​](#positioning "Direct link to Positioning")

Define **exactly** where you want your animations to be placed into the timeline by using the optional [position parameter](/resources/position-parameter/). A number indicates an absolute time (in seconds), or a string with a `"+="` or `"-="` prefix indicates an offset relative to the END of the timeline. For example, `"+=2"` would be 2 seconds after the end, creating a 2-second gap. `"-=2"` would create a 2-second overlap.

### Labels[​](#labels "Direct link to Labels")

Use labels to mark certain spots on the timeline so that you can place animations there or navigate there during playback.

```
//add a label at exactly 3 seconds  
tl.addLabel("step2", 3)  
  
//then later, we can seek() to that spot:  
tl.seek("step2");
```

## Control methods[​](#control-methods "Direct link to Control methods")

[Tween](/docs/v3/GSAP/Tween) and [Timeline](/docs/v3/GSAP/Timeline) both extend an Animation class that exposes a myriad of useful methods and properties. Here are some of the most frequently used:

```
pause()  
play()  
progress()  
restart()  
resume()  
reverse()  
seek()  
time()  
duration()  
timeScale()  
kill()
```

#### loading...

Reference the Tween or Timeline instance with a variable, and then control it whenever you want:

```
//you only need to create a variable if you want to control it later...  
var tween = gsap.to(...);  
var tl = gsap.timeline(); //"tl" short for timeline  
tl.to(...).to(...); //add animations.  
  
//now we can control them...  
tween.pause();  
tween.timeScale(2); //double speed  
tl.seek(3); //jump to 3 seconds in  
tl.progress(0.5); //halfway through  
...
```
