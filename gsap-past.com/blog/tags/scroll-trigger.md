# One post tagged with "ScrollTrigger" | GSAP | Docs & Learning

* Clamp your triggers! - Ever had ScrollTriggered animations at the very top of your page start out partially-scrubbed? Now you can [clamp()](/docs/v3/GSAP/UtilityMethods/clamp()) them! This handy feature ensures that the start and end positions stay within the bounds of the page and ensures that all your "above the fold" elements start off in their native positions.
* Clamp data-speed - More clamping! This time for ScrollSmoother, you can now wrap your data-speed value in [clamp()](/docs/v3/GSAP/UtilityMethods/clamp()) to make the associated element start out in its natural position if it 's within the viewport at the top of the page.
* ScrollSmoother speed - Hold onto your hats (or scroll wheels?) We 've added a speed option to ScrollSmoother which you can use to make the page scroll faster or slower.
