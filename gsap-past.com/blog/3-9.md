* [CustomEase](/docs/v3/Eases/CustomEase) is now in the public downloads as well (and on the CDN)! 'Tis the season to be jolly.
* Brand new Keyframe options that can drastically reduce the amount of code you must write. If you're used to CSS keyframes, you'll love this.
* [Flip Plugin](/docs/v3/Plugins/Flip) got a major overhaul and new features including [batch()](/docs/v3/Plugins/Flip/static.batch()) for complex scenarios.

## FLIP animations for everyone![​](#flip-animations-for-everyone "Direct link to FLIP animations for everyone!")

Flip plugin can give you some *serious* animation superpowers once you learn to think in terms of "FLIP" ("**F**irst", "**L**ast", "**I**nvert", "**P**lay"). Here's a demo that explains the technique:

#### loading...

Sometimes you'll need to deal with state changes that you can't control, or reparenting of elements. Maybe a thumbnail image needs to transition to fill the viewport with `position: fixed`, or a grid of elements must get smoothly re-ordered within a `flexbox` container. This is where [Flip Plugin](/docs/v3/Plugins/Flip) shines!

Here's an example where a video that's in the flow of text seamlessly transitions into `position: fixed` in the corner when you scroll far enough:

Even when the original position of elements could change - like in this spinning container, **FLIP** will handle the transition with ease.

And here's a fan-favorite showing a grid of tiles you can filter by color and Flip smooths everything out:

## New additions to the keyframe syntax[​](#new-additions-to-the-keyframe-syntax "Direct link to New additions to the keyframe syntax")

Video Walkthrough

Keyframes are a great way to animate a target through multiple steps while keeping your code nice and concise. You can think of them as a sub-timeline nested *inside* a tween

Here's a reminder of the existing syntax.

```
gsap.to('.elem', {  
	keyframes: [  
		{ x: 100, duration: 1 },  
		{ y: 200, duration: 1, delay: 0.5 }, // create a 0.5 second gap  
		{ rotation: 360, duration: 2, delay: -0.25 } // overlap by 0.25 seconds  
	]  
});
```

## New Keyframe options[​](#new-keyframe-options "Direct link to New Keyframe options")

### Percent-based keyframes[​](#percent-based-keyframes "Direct link to Percent-based keyframes")

This familiar syntax will make porting animations over from CSS a breeze!  
Instead of using delays and duration in the keyframes themselves, you specify the styles you want at certain waypoints during the animation, and just like CSS, if you omit a property from one of the keyframes the value will interpolate across that gap.

```
gsap.to('.elem', {  
	keyframes: {  
		'0%': { x: 100, y: 100 },  
		'75%': { x: 0 },  
		'100%': { x: 50, y: 50 }  
	},  
	duration: 2  
});
```

### Array-of-values[​](#array-of-values "Direct link to Array-of-values")

Just define an Array of values and they'll get equally distributed. So simple! And you don't need to make sure the Arrays are equal in length. Plenty of flexibility.

```
gsap.to('.elem', {  
	keyframes: {  
		x: [100, 0, 50],  
		y: [100, 0, 50]  
	},  
	duration: 2  
});
```

### **Demos**[​](#demos "Direct link to demos")

With **Object keyframes** and **Percentage keyframes** you can drill down and add different eases into individual keyframes.

#### loading...

You can even combine multiple easing properties, keyframes and normal tween values. 🤯

```
gsap.to('.box', {  
	keyframes: {  
		y: [0, 80, -10, 30, 0],  
		ease: 'none', // ease across the entire set of keyframes (defaults to the one defined in the tween, or "none" if one isn't defined there)  
		easeEach: 'power2.inOut' // ease between each keyframe (defaults to "power1.inOut")  
	},  
	rotate: 180,  
	ease: 'elastic', // the "normal" part of the tween. In this case, it affects "rotate" because it's outside the keyframes  
	duration: 5,  
	stagger: 0.2  
});
```
