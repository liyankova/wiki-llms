# Share

Share your OpenCode conversations.

OpenCode’s share feature allows you to create public links to your OpenCode conversations, so you can collaborate with teammates or get help from others.

---

## [How it works](https://opencode.ai/docs/share#how-it-works)

When you share a conversation, OpenCode:

1. Creates a unique public URL for your session
2. Syncs your conversation history to our servers
3. Makes the conversation accessible via the shareable link — `opncd.ai/s/<share-id>`

---

## [Sharing](https://opencode.ai/docs/share#sharing)

OpenCode supports three sharing modes that control how conversations are shared:

---

### [Manual (default)](https://opencode.ai/docs/share#manual-default)

By default, OpenCode uses manual sharing mode. Sessions are not shared automatically, but you can manually share them using the `/share` command:

```
/share
```

This will generate a unique URL that’ll be copied to your clipboard.

To explicitly set manual mode in your [config file](https://opencode.ai/docs/config):

opencode.json

```
{

"$schema": "https://opncd.ai/config.json",

"share": "manual"

}
```

---

### [Auto-share](https://opencode.ai/docs/share#auto-share)

You can enable automatic sharing for all new conversations by setting the `share` option to `"auto"` in your [config file](https://opencode.ai/docs/config):

opencode.json

```
{

"$schema": "https://opncd.ai/config.json",

"share": "auto"

}
```

With auto-share enabled, every new conversation will automatically be shared and a link will be generated.

---

### [Disabled](https://opencode.ai/docs/share#disabled)

You can disable sharing entirely by setting the `share` option to `"disabled"` in your [config file](https://opencode.ai/docs/config):

opencode.json

```
{

"$schema": "https://opncd.ai/config.json",

"share": "disabled"

}
```

To enforce this across your team for a given project, add it to the `opencode.json` in your project and check into Git.

---

## [Un-sharing](https://opencode.ai/docs/share#un-sharing)

To stop sharing a conversation and remove it from public access:

```
/unshare
```

This will remove the share link and delete the data related to the conversation.

---

## [Privacy](https://opencode.ai/docs/share#privacy)

There are a few things to keep in mind when sharing a conversation.

---

### [Data retention](https://opencode.ai/docs/share#data-retention)

Shared conversations remain accessible until you explicitly unshare them. This
includes:

* Full conversation history
* All messages and responses
* Session metadata

---

### [Recommendations](https://opencode.ai/docs/share#recommendations)

* Only share conversations that don’t contain sensitive information.
* Review conversation content before sharing.
* Unshare conversations when collaboration is complete.
* Avoid sharing conversations with proprietary code or confidential data.
* For sensitive projects, disable sharing entirely.

---

## [For enterprises](https://opencode.ai/docs/share#for-enterprises)

For enterprise deployments, the share feature can be:

* **Disabled** entirely for security compliance
* **Restricted** to users authenticated through SSO only
* **Self-hosted** on your own infrastructure
